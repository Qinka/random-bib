  abstract = {The image database is the system of files that the ANALYZE TM package uses to organize and access image data on the disk. Facilities are provided for converting data from a number of sources for use with the package. A description of the database format is provided to aid developers in porting images from other sources for use with the ANALYZE TM system. An ANALYZE TM image database consists of at least two files: • an image file • a header file The files have the same name being distinguished by the extensions .img for the image file and .hdr for the header file. Thus, for the image database heart, there are the UNIX files heart.img and heart.hdr. The ANALYZE TM programs all refer to this pair of files as a single entity named heart.},

  abstract  = {The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standard, known as DICOM, exists to facilitate communications between imaging devices and systems. By dictating specific data and interface requirements, DICOM helps ensure that devices--particularly devices made by different suppliers--can communicate with one another. Unfortunately, because different devices can implement the standard in different ways, not all devices that comply with the standard will be compatible. Thus, it's not enough for healthcare facilities to determine whether a device complies with the DICOM standard; they must also analyze how each device complies with the standard. This Reference Guide is intended to provide readers with the background information they need to perform such analyses. The Guide includes the following articles: THE BASICS: This article provides a brief overview of DICOM for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with the standard. THE DETAILS: This article focuses on the specific DICOM components that readers will need to understand when working with the standard. EVALUATING DICOM CONFORMANCE STATEMENTS: This article describes how to determine whether, and to what degree, two devices will support communication with one another. In addition to offering detailed, step-by-step guidance, we include a DICOM Compatibility Matching Form to help readers organize the data they'll be analyzing during the evaluation process.},
