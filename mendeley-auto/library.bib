abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Application of deep learning algorithms to whole-slide pathology imagescan potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. OBJECTIVE: Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). EXPOSURES: Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4{\%} [95{\%} CI, 64.3{\%}-80.4{\%}]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95{\%} CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P {\textless}.001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95{\%} CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting.},

In this paper, we exploit the capability of global context information by different-region-based context aggregation through our pyramid pooling module together with the proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet). Our global prior representation is effective to produce good quality results on the scene parsing task, while PSPNet provides a superior framework for pixel-level prediction. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. It came first in ImageNet scene parsing challenge 2016, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and Cityscapes benchmark. A single PSPNet yields the new record of mIoU accuracy 85.4{\%} on PASCAL VOC 2012 and accuracy 80.2{\%} on Cityscapes.},

abstract = {Several studies have linked codeletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q in low-grade gliomas (LGG) with positive response to treatment and longer progression-free survival. Hence, predicting 1p/19q status is crucial for effective treatment planning of LGG. In this study, we predict the 1p/19q status from MR images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which could be a non-invasive alternative to surgical biopsy and histopathological analysis. Our method consists of three main steps: image registration, tumor segmentation, and classification of 1p/19q status using CNN. We included a total of 159 LGG with 3 image slices each who had biopsy-proven 1p/19q status (57 non-deleted and 102 codeleted) and preoperative postcontrast-T1 (T1C) and T2 images. We divided our data into training, validation, and test sets. The training data was balanced for equal class probability and was then augmented with iterations of random translational shift, rotation, and horizontal and vertical flips to increase the size of the training set. We shuffled and augmented the training data to counter overfitting in each epoch. Finally, we evaluated several configurations of a multi-scale CNN architecture until training and validation accuracies became consistent. The results of the best performing configuration on the unseen test set were 93.3{\%} (sensitivity), 82.22{\%} (specificity), and 87.7{\%} (accuracy). Multi-scale CNN with their self-learning capability provides promising results for predicting 1p/19q status non-invasively based on T1C and T2 images. Predicting 1p/19q status non-invasively from MR images would allow selecting effective treatment strategies for LGG patients without the need for surgical biopsy.},

abstract = {GAN inversion aims to invert a given image back into the latent space of a pretrained GAN model, for the image to be faithfully reconstructed from the inverted code by the generator. As an emerging technique to bridge the real and fake image domains, GAN inversion plays an essential role in enabling the pretrained GAN models such as StyleGAN and BigGAN to be used for real image editing applications. Meanwhile, GAN inversion also provides insights on the interpretation of GAN's latent space and how the realistic images can be generated. In this paper, we provide an overview of GAN inversion with a focus on its recent algorithms and applications. We cover important techniques of GAN inversion and their applications to image restoration and image manipulation. We further elaborate on some trends and challenges for future directions.},

The training data consisted of five subjects with a mean of 4.4 time-points, and test data of fourteen subjects with a mean of 4.4 time-points. All 82 data sets had the white matter lesions associated with multiple sclerosis delineated by two human expert raters. Eleven teams submitted results using state-of-the-art lesion segmentation algorithms to the challenge, with ten teams presenting their results at the conference. We present a quantitative evaluation comparing the consistency of the two raters as well as exploring the performance of the eleven submitted results in addition to three other lesion segmentation algorithms. The challenge presented three unique opportunities: (1) the sharing of a rich data set; (2) collaboration and comparison of the various avenues of research being pursued in the community; and (3) a review and refinement of the evaluation metrics currently in use. We report on the performance of the challenge participants, as well as the construction and evaluation of a consensus delineation. The image data and manual delineations will continue to be available for download, through an evaluation website2 The Challenge Evaluation Website is: http://smart-stats-tools.org/lesion-challenge-2015 as a resource for future researchers in the area.

However, there is few comprehensive study explaining the connections among different GANs variants, and how they have evolved. In this paper, we attempt to provide a review on various GANs methods from the perspectives of algorithms, theory, and applications. Firstly, the motivations, mathematical representations, and structure of most GANs algorithms are introduced in details. Furthermore, GANs have been combined with other machine learning algorithms for specific applications, such as semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. This paper compares the commonalities and differences of these GANs methods. Secondly, theoretical issues related to GANs are investigated. Thirdly, typical applications of GANs in image processing and computer vision, natural language processing, music, speech and audio, medical field, and data science are illustrated. Finally, the future open research problems for GANs are pointed out.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of progression in subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for enrolling the right subjects in clinical trials. However, a prospective comparison of state-of-the-art algorithms for predicting disease onset and progression is currently lacking. We present the findings of The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge, which compared the performance of 92 algorithms from 33 international teams at predicting the future trajectory of 219 individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease. Challenge participants were required to make a prediction, for each month of a 5-year future time period, of three key outcomes: clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog13), and total volume of the ventricles. No single submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For clinical diagnosis and ventricle volume prediction, the best algorithms strongly outperform simple baselines in predictive ability. However, for ADAS-Cog13 no single submitted prediction method was significantly better than random guessing. On a limited, cross-sectional subset of the data emulating clinical trials, performance of best algorithms at predicting clinical diagnosis decreased only slightly (3{\%} error increase) compared to the full longitudinal dataset. Two ensemble methods based on taking the mean and median over all predictions, obtained top scores on almost all tasks. Better than average performance at diagnosis prediction was generally associated with the additional inclusion of features from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). On the other hand, better performance at ventricle volume prediction was associated with inclusion of summary statistics, such as patient-specific biomarker trends. The submission system remains open via the website https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org, while code for submissions is being collated by TADPOLE SHARE: https://tadpole-share.github.io/. Our work suggests that current prediction algorithms are accurate for biomarkers related to clinical diagnosis and ventricle volume, opening up the possibility of cohort refinement in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89{\%} and 82.1{\%} without any post-processing.

abstract = {Tumor proliferation is an important biomarker indicative of the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Assessment of tumor proliferation in a clinical setting is a highly subjective and labor-intensive task. Previous efforts to automate tumor proliferation assessment by image analysis only focused on mitosis detection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario, automatic mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs) and an automatic method should be able to produce a tumor proliferation score given a WSI as input. To address this, we organized the TUmor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation scores from WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing breast cancer histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent evaluation, only the ground truth for the training dataset was provided to the challenge participants. The first task of the challenge was to predict mitotic scores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation by a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based PAM50 proliferation scores from the WSI. The best performing automatic method for the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa score of $\kappa$ = 0.567, 95{\%} CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the ground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a Spearman's correlation coefficient of r = 0.617, 95{\%} CI [0.581 0.651] with the ground truth. This was the first comparison study that investigated tumor proliferation assessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given the difficulty of the tasks and weakly-labeled nature of the ground truth. However, further research is needed to improve the practical utility of image analysis methods for this task.},

abstract = {In order to achieve database-free (DB-free) vision-based monitoring on construction sites, this paper proposes a deep active learning approach that automatically evaluates the uncertainty of unlabeled training data, selects the most meaningful-to-learn instances, and eventually trains a deep learning model with the selected data. The proposed approach thus involves three sequential processes: (1) uncertainty evaluation of unlabeled data, (2) training data sampling and user-interactive labeling, and (3) model design and training. Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method and confirm the positive effects of active learning: one experiment with active learning and the other without active learning (i.e., with random learning). In the experiments, the research team used a total of 17,000 images collected from actual construction sites. To achieve 80{\%} mean Average Precision (mAP) for construction object detection, the random learning method required 720 training images, whereas only 180 images were sufficient when exploiting active learning. Moreover, the active learning could build a deep learning model with the mAP of 93.0{\%}, while that of the random learning approach was limited to 89.1{\%}. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method and highlight the considerable positive impacts of uncertainty-based data sampling on the model's performance. This research can improve the practicality of vision-based monitoring on construction sites, and the findings of this study can provide valuable insights and new research directions for construction researchers.},

abstract = {Astounding results from transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. This has led to exciting progress on a number of tasks while requiring minimal inductive biases in the model design. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformer models in the computer vision discipline and assumes little to no prior background in the field. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of transformer models i.e., self-supervision and self-attention. Transformer architectures leverage self-attention mechanisms to encode long-range dependencies in the input domain which makes them highly expressive. Since they assume minimal prior knowledge about the structure of the problem, self-supervision using pretext tasks is applied to pre-train transformer models on large-scale (unlabelled) datasets. The learned representations are then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks, typically leading to excellent performance due to the generalization and expressivity of encoded features. We cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering and visual reasoning), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.},

To evaluate models robustly and to get an estimate of radiologist performance, we collect additional labels from six boardcertified Stanford radiologists on the test set, consisting of 207 musculoskeletal studies. On this test set, the majority vote of a group of three radiologists serves as gold standard. We train a 169-layer DenseNet baseline model to detect and localize abnormalities. Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.929, with an operating point of 0.815 sensitivity and 0.887 specificity. We compare our model and radiologists on the Cohen's kappa statistic, which expresses the agreement of our model and of each radiologist with the gold standard. Model performance is comparable to the best radiologist performance in detecting abnormalities on finger and wrist studies. However, model performance is lower than best radiologist performance in detecting abnormalities on elbow, forearm, hand, humerus, and shoulder studies. We believe that the task is a good challenge for future research. To encourage advances, we have made our dataset freely available at http://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura.},

The adversarial loss brought by the discriminator provides a clever way of incorporating unlabeled samples into training and imposing higher order consistency. This has proven to be useful in many cases, such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and image-to-image translation. These properties have attracted researchers in the medical imaging community, and we have seen rapid adoption in many traditional and novel applications, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, detection, classification, and cross-modality synthesis. Based on our observations, this trend will continue and we therefore conducted a review of recent advances in medical imaging using the adversarial training scheme with the hope of benefiting researchers interested in this technique.},

abstract = {We present a novel spatial hashing based data structure to facilitate 3D shape analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method builds hierarchical hash tables for an input model under different resolutions that leverage the sparse occupancy of 3D shape boundary. Based on this data structure, we design two efficient GPU algorithms namely hash2col and col2hash so that the CNN operations like convolution and pooling can be efficiently parallelized. The perfect spatial hashing is employed as our spatial hashing scheme, which is not only free of hash collision but also nearly minimal so that our data structure is almost of the same size as the raw input. Compared with existing 3D CNN methods, our data structure significantly reduces the memory footprint during the CNN training. As the input geometry features are more compactly packed, CNN operations also run faster with our data structure. The experiment shows that, under the same network structure, our method yields comparable or better benchmark results compared with the state-of-the-art while it has only one-third memory consumption when under high resolutions (i.e. 256 3).},

Beginning in 1992, MINC was developed as a system for flexible, self-documenting representation of neuroscientific imaging data with arbitrary orientation and dimensionality. The MINC system incorporates three broad components: a file format specification, a programming library, and a growing set of tools. In the early 2000's the MINC developers created MINC 2.0, which added support for 64-bit file sizes, internal compression, and a number of other modern features. Because of its extensible design, it has been easy to incorporate details of provenance in the header metadata, including an explicit processing history, unique identifiers, and vendor-specific scanner settings. This makes MINC ideal for use in large scale imaging studies and databases. It also makes it easy to adapt to new scanning sequences and modalities.},

abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is widely used for mapping the structural connections of the human brain. Its accuracy is known to be limited by technical factors affecting in vivo data acquisition, such as noise, artifacts, and data undersampling resulting from scan time constraints. It generally is assumed that improvements in data quality and implementation of sophisticated tractography methods will lead to increasingly accurate maps of human anatomical connections. However, assessing the anatomical accuracy of DWI tractography is difficult because of the lack of independent knowledge of the true anatomical connections in humans. Here we investigate the future prospects of DWI-based connectional imaging by applying advanced tractography methods to an ex vivo DWI dataset of the macaque brain. The results of different tractography methods were compared with maps of known axonal projections from previous tracer studies in the macaque. Despite the exceptional quality of the DWI data, none of the methods demonstrated high anatomical accuracy. The methods that showed the highest sensitivity showed the lowest specificity, and vice versa. Additionally, anatomical accuracy was highly dependent upon parameters of the tractography algorithm, with different optimal values for mapping different pathways. These results suggest that there is an inherent limitation in determining long-range anatomical projections based on voxelaveraged estimates of local fiber orientation obtained from DWI data that is unlikely to be overcome by improvements in data acquisition and analysis alone.},

Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks.},

@article{Kim2019a,
abstract = {This paper presents a client/server privacy-preserving network in the context of multicentric medical image analysis. Our approach is based on adversarial learning which encodes images to obfuscate the patient identity while preserving enough information for a target task. Our novel architecture is composed of three components: 1) an encoder network which removes identity-specific features from input medical images, 2) a discriminator network that attempts to identify the subject from the encoded images, 3) a medical image analysis network which analyzes the content of the encoded images (segmentation in our case). By simultaneously fooling the discriminator and optimizing the medical analysis network, the encoder learns to remove privacy-specific features while keeping those essentials for the target task. Our approach is illustrated on the problem of segmenting brain MRI from the large-scale Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Using longitudinal data from PPMI, we show that the discriminator learns to heavily distort input images while allowing for highly accurate segmentation results. Our results also demonstrate that an encoder trained on the PPMI dataset can be used for segmenting other datasets, without the need for retraining.

abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a pervasive pediatric white blood cell cancer across the globe. With the popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable attention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence, these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However, the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the non-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the malignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper discusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The proposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNet$\theta$ is a 2-module framework that utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel SVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses features through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the auxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved quantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB images. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers for decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class labels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released public dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the validity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level variability. A weighted F1 score of 94.8{\%} is obtained that is best so far on this challenging dataset.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks have been widely adopted for automatic organ segmentation from abdominal CT scans. However, the segmentation accuracy of some small organs (e.g., the pancreas) is sometimes below satisfaction, arguably because deep networks are easily disrupted by the complex and variable background regions which occupies a large fraction of the input volume. In this paper, we formulate this problem into a fixed-point model which uses a predicted segmentation mask to shrink the input region. This is motivated by the fact that a smaller input region often leads to more accurate segmentation. In the training process, we use the ground-truth annotation to generate accurate input regions and optimize network weights. On the testing stage, we fix the network parameters and update the segmentation results in an iterative manner. We evaluate our approach on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset, and outperform the state-of-the-art by more than 4{\%}, measured by the average Dice-S{\o}rensen Coefficient (DSC). In addition, we report 62.43{\%} DSC in the worst case, which guarantees the reliability of our approach in clinical applications.},

We define this as network morphism in this research. After morphing a parent network, the child network is expected to inherit the knowledge from its parent network and also has the potential to continue growing into a more powerful one with much shortened training time. The first requirement for this network morphism is its ability to handle diverse morphing types of networks, including changes of depth, width, kernel size, and even subnet. To meet this requirement, we first introduce the network morphism equations, and then develop novel morphing algorithms for all these morphing types for both classic and convolutional neural networks. The second requirement is its ability to deal with non-linearity in a network. We propose a family of parametric-activation functions to facilitate the morphing of any continuous nonlinear activation neurons. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and typical neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network morphism scheme.},

abstract = {With increasing life expectancy in developed countries, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its socioeconomic impact are growing. Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of AD facilitates the development of treatment strategies aimed at slowing down or preventing neuronal death. AD treatment trials using clinical outcome measures require long observation times and large patient samples. There is increasing evidence that neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers may provide information that may reduce sample sizes and observation periods. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative will help identify clinical, neuroimaging, and biomarker outcome measures that provide the highest power for measurement of longitudinal changes and for prediction of transitions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The top-k error is a common measure of performance in machine learning and computer vision. In practice, top-k classification is typically performed with deep neural networks trained with the cross-entropy loss. Theoretical results indeed suggest that cross-entropy is an optimal learning objective for such a task in the limit of infinite data. In the context of limited and noisy data however, the use of a loss function that is specifically designed for top-k classification can bring significant improvements. Our empirical evidence suggests that the loss function must be smooth and have non-sparse gradients in order to work well with deep neural networks. Consequently, we introduce a family of smoothed loss functions that are suited to top-k optimization via deep learning. The widely used cross-entropy is a special case of our family. Evaluating our smooth loss functions is computationally challenging: a na{\"{i}}ve algorithm would require O(nk) operations, where n is the number of classes. Thanks to a connection to polynomial algebra and a divideand- conquer approach, we provide an algorithm with a time complexity of O(kn). Furthermore, we present a novel approximation to obtain fast and stable algorithms on GPUs with single floating point precision. We compare the performance of the cross-entropy loss and our margin-based losses in various regimes of noise and data size, for the predominant use case of k = 5. Our investigation reveals that our loss is more robust to noise and overfitting than cross-entropy.},

The ongoing advances of deep convolutional neural networks clearly demonstrate the benefit of supervised learning to successfully extract relevant anatomical information and aid image-based analysis and interventions, but it heavily relies on labeled data. Self-supervised learning, that requires no expert labels, provides an appealing way to discover data-inherent patterns and leverage anatomical information freely available from medical images themselves. In this work, we propose a new approach to train effective convolutional feature extractors based on a new concept of image-intrinsic spatial offset relations with an auxiliary heatmap regression loss. The learned features successfully capture semantic, anatomical information and enable state-of-the-art accuracy for a k-NN based one-shot segmentation task without any subsequent fine-tuning.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for automatic medical image segmentation. However, they have not demonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In addition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the lack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes (a.k.a. zero-shot learning). To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based interactive segmentation framework by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based segmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine tuning to make a CNN model adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised (without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional scribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and interaction-based uncertainty for the fine tuning. We applied this framework to two applications: 2-D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal magnetic resonance (MR) slices, where only two types of these organs were annotated for training and 3-D segmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor (including edema) from different MR sequences, where only the tumor core in one MR sequence was annotated for training. Experimental results show that: 1) our model is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art CNNs; 2) image-specific fine tuning with the proposed weighted loss function significantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to accurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than traditional interactive segmentation methods.},

abstract = {The need to largely reduce the amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions in the coming years all over the world requires a large effort in decarbonising the economy. One of the sectors most in need of this effort is the transportation sector. In fact, only a large reduction of CO2 emissions in this sector will allow coping effectively with this problem. There are two ways to perform it (1) by increasing the amount of biofuels to be used by Internal Combustion Motors or (2) by making a shift towards electromobility. However, this shift towards the electrification of the transportation sector can only be well succeeded if one increases simultaneously the proportion of non-CO2-emitting power generation technologies, namely renewable based power sources. European Union (EU) is developing a large effort on these matters. In fact, the energy-related targets set by EU policy require careful exami- nation of potential solutions for the integration of renewable energy sources to meet the electricity demand. On the other side, the expected growing energy demand resulting from the introduction of electric-powered cars needs the development of innovative concepts to exploit the variable power supply. The application of dynamic techniques for prediction of electricity supply and demand, including electricity prices in the market, is expected to support the optimisation of the grid balance. The European wind markets predict an installed capacity that would provide 14 {\%} of the electricity consumption in 2020. Today in Denmark and Portugal, the wind power accounts for more than 20 {\%} of the power production.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable results over the last several years for a wide range of computer vision tasks. A new architecture recently introduced by Sabour et al. [2017], referred to as a capsule networks with dynamic routing, has shown great initial results for digit recognition and small image classification. The success of capsule networks lies in their ability to preserve more information about the input by replacing max-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for preservation of part-whole relationships in the data. This preservation of the input is demonstrated by reconstructing the input from the output capsule vectors. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object segmentation for the first time in the literature. We extend the idea of convolutional capsules with locally-connected routing and propose the concept of deconvolutional capsules. Further, we extend the masked reconstruction to reconstruct the positive input class. The proposed convolutionaldeconvolutional capsule network, called SegCaps, shows strong results for the task of object segmentation with substantial decrease in parameter space. As an example application, we applied the proposed SegCaps to segment pathological lungs from low dose CT scans and compared its accuracy and efficiency with other U-Net-based architectures. SegCaps is able to handle large image sizes (512 × 512) as opposed to baseline capsules (typically less than 32 × 32). The proposed SegCaps reduced the number of parameters of U-Net architecture by 95.4{\%} while still providing a better segmentation accuracy.},

In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGANs) aimed at generating high-resolution photo-realistic images. First, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v1, for text-to-image synthesis. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of a scene based on a given text description, yielding low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and the text description as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. Second, an advanced multi-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v2, is proposed for both conditional and unconditional generative tasks. Our StackGAN-v2 consists of multiple generators and multiple discriminators arranged in a tree-like structure; images at multiple scales corresponding to the same scene are generated from different branches of the tree. StackGAN-v2 shows more stable training behavior than StackGAN-v1 by jointly approximating multiple distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed stacked generative adversarial networks significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods in generating photo-realistic images.},

abstract = {Vision science, particularly machine vision, has been revolutionized by introducing large-scale image datasets and statistical learning approaches. Yet, human neuroimaging studies of visual perception still rely on small numbers of images (around 100) due to time-constrained experimental procedures. To apply statistical learning approaches that integrate neuroscience, the number of images used in neuroimaging must be significantly increased. We present BOLD5000, a human functional MRI (fMRI) study that includes almost 5,000 distinct images depicting real-world scenes. Beyond dramatically increasing image dataset size relative to prior fMRI studies, BOLD5000 also accounts for image diversity, overlapping with standard computer vision datasets by incorporating images from the Scene UNderstanding (SUN), Common Objects in Context (COCO), and ImageNet datasets. The scale and diversity of these image datasets, combined with a slow event-related fMRI design, enable fine-grained exploration into the neural representation of a wide range of visual features, categories, and semantics. Concurrently, BOLD5000 brings us closer to realizing Marr's dream of a singular vision science - the intertwined study of biological and computer vision.},

The Challenge provided sets of calibration and testing scans, established a performance assessment process, and created an infrastructure for case dissemination and result submission. Ten groups applied their own methods to 73 lung nodules (37 benign and 36 malignant) that were selected to achieve approximate size matching between the two cohorts. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for these methods ranged from 0.50 to 0.68; only three methods performed statistically better than random guessing. The radiologists' AUC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.85; three radiologists performed statistically better than the best-performing computer method. The LUNGx Challenge compared the performance of computerized methods in the task of differentiating benign from malignant lung nodules on CT scans, placed in the context of the performance of radiologists on the same task.

Three rating experiments were conducted. In the first Stimulus Selection experiment, participants rated short music clips for valence and arousal, and the most evocative clips were selected. In two follow-up Stimulus Validation experiments, two additional groups of participants rated the selected musical and non-musical stimuli, with Experiment 3 confirming that these stimuli work effectively in a noisy environment (within an MRI scanner).

The development of automated methods for nuclear segmentation and classification enables the quantitative analysis of tens of thousands of nuclei within a whole-slide pathology image, opening up possibilities of further analysis of large-scale nuclear morphometry. However, automated nuclear segmentation and classification is faced with a major challenge in that there are several different types of nuclei, some of them exhibiting large intra-class variability such as the nuclei of tumour cells. Additionally, some of the nuclei are often clustered together. To address these challenges, we present a novel convolutional neural network for simultaneous nuclear segmentation and classification that leverages the instance-rich information encoded within the vertical and horizontal distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass. These distances are then utilised to separate clustered nuclei, resulting in an accurate segmentation, particularly in areas with overlapping instances. Then, for each segmented instance the network predicts the type of nucleus via a devoted up-sampling branch. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods on multiple independent multi-tissue histology image datasets.

However, they have practical difficulties when operating on high-dimensional parameter spaces in extreme low-data regimes. We show that it is possible to bypass these limitations by learning a data-dependent latent generative representation of model parameters, and performing gradient-based meta-learning in this low-dimensional latent space. The resulting approach, latent embedding optimization (LEO), decouples the gradient-based adaptation procedure from the underlying high-dimensional space of model parameters. Our evaluation shows that LEO can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the competitive miniImageNet and tieredImageNet few-shot classification tasks. Further analysis indicates LEO is able to capture uncertainty in the data, and can perform adaptation more effectively by optimizing in latent space.},

It is expected to have the ability of memorization and it is regarded as one of the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence technology. However, incremental learning remains a long term challenge. Modern deep neural network models achieve outstanding performance on stationary data distributions with batch training. This restriction leads to catastrophic forgetting for incremental learning scenarios since the distribution of incoming data is unknown and has a highly different probability from the old data. Therefore, a model must be both plastic to acquire new knowledge and stable to consolidate existing knowledge. This review aims to draw a systematic review of the state of the art of incremental learning methods. Published reports are selected from Web of Science, IEEEXplore, and DBLP databases up to May 2020. Each paper is reviewed according to the types: architectural strategy, regularization strategy and rehearsal and pseudo-rehearsal strategy. We compare and discuss different methods. Moreover, the development trend and research focus are given. It is concluded that incremental learning is still a hot research area and will be for a long period.

abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the submissions to the first edition of the Endoscopy Artefact Detection challenge (EAD). Using crowd-sourcing, this initiative is a step towards understanding the limitations of existing state-of-the-art computer vision methods applied to endoscopy and promoting the development of new approaches suitable for clinical translation. Endoscopy is a routine imaging technique for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases in hollow-organs; the esophagus, stomach, colon, uterus and the bladder. However the nature of these organs prevent imaged tissues to be free of imaging artefacts such as bubbles, pixel saturation, organ specularity and debris, all of which pose substantial challenges for any quantitative analysis. Consequently, the potential for improved clinical outcomes through quantitative assessment of abnormal mucosal surface observed in endoscopy videos is presently not realized accurately. The EAD challenge promotes awareness of and addresses this key bottleneck problem by investigating methods that can accurately classify, localize and segment artefacts in endoscopy frames as critical prerequisite tasks. Using a diverse curated multi-institutional, multi-modality, multi-organ dataset of video frames, the accuracy and performance of 23 algorithms were objectively ranked for artefact detection and segmentation. The ability of methods to generalize to unseen datasets was also evaluated. The best performing methods (top 15{\%}) propose deep learning strategies to reconcile variabilities in artefact appearance with respect to size, modality, occurrence and organ type. However, no single method outperformed across all tasks. Detailed analyses reveal the shortcomings of current training strategies and highlight the need for developing new optimal metrics to accurately quantify the clinical applicability of methods.},

abstract = {To better understand early brain development in health and disorder, it is critical to accurately segment infant brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance; however, one of the major limitations is that the learning-based methods may suffer from the multi-site issue, that is, the models trained on a dataset from one site may not be applicable to the datasets acquired from other sites with different imaging protocols/scanners. To promote methodological development in the community, the iSeg-2019 challenge (http://iseg2019.web.unc.edu) provides a set of 6-month infant subjects from multiple sites with different protocols/scanners for the participating methods. Training/validation subjects are from UNC (MAP) and testing subjects are from UNC/UMN (BCP), Stanford University, and Emory University. By the time of writing, there are 30 automatic segmentation methods participated in the iSeg-2019. In this article, 8 top-ranked methods were reviewed by detailing their pipelines/implementations, presenting experimental results, and evaluating performance across different sites in terms of whole brain, regions of interest, and gyral landmark curves. We further pointed out their limitations and possible directions for addressing the multi-site issue. We find that multi-site consistency is still an open issue. We hope that the multi-site dataset in the iSeg-2019 and this review article will attract more researchers to address the challenging and critical multi-site issue in practice.},

abstract = {The creation of practical deep learning data-products often requires parallelization across processors and computers to make deep learning feasible on large data sets, but bottlenecks in communication bandwidth make it difficult to attain good speedups through parallelism. Here we develop and test 8-bit approximation algorithms which make better use of the available bandwidth by compressing 32-bit gradients and nonlinear activations to 8-bit approximations. We show that these approximations do not decrease predictive performance on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet for both model and data parallelism and provide a data transfer speedup of 2x relative to 32-bit parallelism. We build a predictive model for speedups based on our experimental data, verify its validity on known speedup data, and show that we can obtain a speedup of 50x and more on a system of 96 GPUs compared to a speedup of 23x for 32-bit. We compare our data types with other methods and show that 8-bit approximations achieve state-of-the-art speedups for model parallelism. Thus 8-bit approximation is an efficient method to parallelize convolutional networks on very large systems of GPUs.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is an accepted and successful therapy for both acute and chronic liver diseases (CLDs), with good survival outcomes. Whilst the study of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) post transplantation for CLDs have been well documented, there is little data measuring HRQoL following liver transplantation for acute liver failure (ALF) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected using between-method triangulation; however, only the quantitative element of the study is reported here. Measuring eight health domains, we distributed the short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire by post to 96 acute and chronic transplant recipients. Differences between the groups were measured using both parametric and non-parametric t-tests. RESULTS: Overall, the patients showed a satisfactory HRQoL; there were no differences between either acute or chronic transplant groups in seven of the eight domains of quality of life. Among the patients transplanted for ALF, there were no differences in HRQoL between patients transplanted for paracetamol hepatotoxicity compared with other indications, and no variations in HRQoL related to recipient gender, employment or length of survival post transplantation. When compared with the UK SF-36 normal values to the ALF transplant recipients, there was a significantly lower physical functioning and role emotional scores. CONCLUSION: Regardless of aetiology, most of recipients transplanted for ALF have a HRQoL comparable with chronic transplant recipients.},

abstract = {Delineation of the cardiac structures from 2D echocardiographic images is a common clinical task to establish a diagnosis. Over the past decades, the automation of this task has been the subject of intense research. In this paper, we evaluate how far the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder deep convolutional neural network methods can go at assessing 2D echocardiographic images, i.e., segmenting cardiac structures and estimating clinical indices, on a dataset, especially, designed to answer this objective. We, therefore, introduce the cardiac acquisitions for multi-structure ultrasound segmentation dataset, the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for the purpose of echocardiographic assessment. The dataset contains two and four-chamber acquisitions from 500 patients with reference measurements from one cardiologist on the full dataset and from three cardiologists on a fold of 50 patients. Results show that encoder-decoder-based architectures outperform state-of-the-art non-deep learning methods and faithfully reproduce the expert analysis for the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes, with a mean correlation of 0.95 and an absolute mean error of 9.5 ml. Concerning the ejection fraction of the left ventricle, results are more contrasted with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.80 and an absolute mean error of 5.6{\%}. Although these results are below the inter-observer scores, they remain slightly worse than the intra-observer's ones. Based on this observation, areas for improvement are defined, which open the door for accurate and fully-automatic analysis of 2D echocardiographic images.},

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation. However, analyzing large rehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but are labor intensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the results often lack accuracy. Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet these require large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke), an open-source dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and metadata. This large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion segmentation algorithms and provides a standardized dataset for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS release 1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current lesion segmentation methods.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We improve the accuracy of the regressed semantic 3D maps by a novel architecture based on adversarial learning. In particular, we suggest using multiple adversarial loss terms that not only enforce realistic outputs with respect to the ground truth, but also an effective embedding of the internal features. This is done by correlating the latent features of the encoder working on partial 2.5D data with the latent features extracted from a variational 3D auto-encoder trained to reconstruct the complete semantic scene. In addition, differently from other approaches that operate entirely through 3D convolutions, at test time we retain the original 2.5D structure of the input during downsampling to improve the effectiveness of the internal representation of our model. We test our approach on the main benchmark datasets for semantic scene completion to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our proposal.},

abstract = {Active learning is a unique abstraction of machine learning techniques where the model/algorithm could guide users for annotation of a set of data points that would be beneficial to the model, unlike passive machine learning. The primary advantage being that active learning frameworks select data points that can accelerate the learning process of amodel and can reduce the amount of data needed to achieve full accuracy as compared to a model trained on a randomly acquired data set. Multiple frameworks for active learning combined with deep learning have been proposed, and the majority of them are dedicated to classification tasks. Herein, we explore active learning for the task of segmentation of medical imaging data sets. We investigate our proposed framework using two datasets: 1.) MRI scans of the hippocampus, 2.) CT scans of pancreas and tumors. This work presents a query-by-committee approach for active learning where a joint optimizer is used for the committee. At the same time, we propose three new strategies for active learning: 1.) increasing frequency of uncertain data to bias the training data set; 2.) Using mutual information among the input images as a regularizer for acquisition to ensure diversity in the training dataset; 3.) adaptation of Dice log-likelihood for Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). The results indicate an improvement in terms of data reduction by achieving full accuracy while only using 22.69 {\%} and 48.85 {\%} of the available data for each dataset, respectively.},

abstract = {Medical image segmentation has achieved remarkable advancements using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs often need big amounts of data and annotations for training, both of which can be difficult and costly to obtain. In this work, we propose a unified framework for generalized low-shot (one- and few-shot) medical image segmentation based on distance metric learning (DML). Unlike most existing methods which only deal with the lack of annotations while assuming abundance of data, our framework works with extreme scarcity of both, which is ideal for rare diseases. Via DML, the framework learns a multimodal mixture representation for each category, and performs dense predictions based on cosine distances between the pixels{\&}{\#}x2019; deep embeddings and the category representations. The multimodal representations effectively utilize the inter-subject similarities and intraclass variations to overcome overfitting due to extremely limited data. In addition, we propose adaptive mixing coefficients for the multimodal mixture distributions to adaptively emphasize the modes better suited to the current input. The representations are implicitly embedded as weights of the fc layer, such that the cosine distances can be computed efficiently via forward propagation. In our experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT datasets, the proposed framework achieves superior performances for low-shot segmentation towards standard DNN-based (3D U-Net) and classical registration-based (ANTs) methods, e.g., achieving mean Dice coefficients of 81{\%}/69{\%} for brain tissue/abdominal multi-organ segmentation using a single training sample, as compared to 52{\%}/31{\%} and 72{\%}/35{\%} by the U-Net and ANTs, respectively.},

abstract = {Background and purpose This project assessed performance of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for classification of brain MRI radiology reports into acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and non-AIS phenotypes. Materials and methods All brain MRI reports from a single academic institution over a two year period were randomly divided into 2 groups for ML: Training (70{\%}) and testing (30{\%}). Using "quanteda" NLP package, all text data were parsed into tokens to create the data frequency matrix. Ten-fold cross-validation was applied for bias correction of the training set. Labeling for AIS was performed manually, identifying clinical notes. We applied binary logistic regression, na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian classification, single decision tree, and support vector machine for the binary classifiers, and we assessed performance of the algorithms by F1-measure. We also assessed how n-grams or term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting affected the performance of the algorithms. Results Of all 3,204 brain MRI documents, 432 (14.3{\%}) were labeled as AIS. AIS documents were longer in character length than those of non-AIS (median [interquartile range]; 551 [377- 681] vs. 309 [164-396]). Of all ML algorithms, single decision tree had the highest F1-measure (93.2) and accuracy (98.0{\%}). Adding bigrams to the ML model improved F1-mesaure of na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian classification, but not in others, and term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting to data frequency matrix did not show any additional performance improvements. Conclusions Supervised ML based NLP algorithms are useful for automatic classification of brain MRI reports for identification of AIS patients. Single decision tree was the best classifier to identify brain MRI reports with AIS.},

abstract = {Photoacoustic imaging is a non-ionizing imaging modality that provides contrast consistent with optical imaging techniques while the resolution and penetration depth is similar to ultrasound techniques. In a previous publication Opt. Express 18, 11406 (2010), a technique was introduced to experimentally acquire the imaging operator for a photoacoustic imaging system. While this was an important foundation for future work, we have recently improved the experimental procedure allowing for a more densely populated imaging operator to be acquired. Subsets of the imaging operator were produced by varying the transducer count as well as the measurement space temporal sampling rate. Examination of the matrix rank and the effect of contributing object space singular vectors to image reconstruction were performed. For a PAI system collecting only limited data projections, matrix rank increased linearly with transducer count and measurement space temporal sampling rate. Image reconstruction using a regularized pseudoinverse of the imaging operator was performed on photoacoustic signals from a point source, line source, and an array of point sources derived from the imaging operator. As expected, image quality increased for each object with increasing transducer count and measurement space temporal sampling rate. Using the same approach, but on experimentally sampled photoacoustic signals from a moving point-like source, acquisition, data transfer, reconstruction and image display took 1.4 s using one laser pulse per 3D frame. With relatively simple hardware improvements to data transfer and computation speed, our current imaging results imply that acquisition and display of 3D photoacoustic images at laser repetition rates of 10Hz is easily achieved.},

The overarching objective of this paper is to measure how far state-of-the-art deep learning methods can go at assessing CMRI, i.e., segmenting the myocardium and the two ventricles as well as classifying pathologies. In the wake of the 2017 MICCAI-ACDC challenge, we report results from deep learning methods provided by nine research groups for the segmentation task and four groups for the classification task. Results show that the best methods faithfully reproduce the expert analysis, leading to a mean value of 0.97 correlation score for the automatic extraction of clinical indices and an accuracy of 0.96 for automatic diagnosis. These results clearly open the door to highly accurate and fully automatic analysis of cardiac CMRI. We also identify scenarios for which deep learning methods are still failing. Both the dataset and detailed results are publicly available online, while the platform will remain open for new submissions.},

abstract = {In 2018, clinics and hospitals were hit with numerous attacks leading to significant data breaches and interruptions in medical services. An attacker with access to medical records can do much more than hold the data for ransom or sell it on the black market. In this paper, we show how an attacker can use deep-learning to add or remove evidence of medical conditions from volumetric (3D) medical scans. An attacker may perform this act in order to stop a political candidate, sabotage research, commit insurance fraud, perform an act of terrorism, or even commit murder. We implement the attack using a 3D conditional GAN and show how the framework (CT-GAN) can be automated. Although the body is complex and 3D medical scans are very large, CT-GAN achieves realistic results which can be executed in milliseconds. To evaluate the attack, we focused on injecting and removing lung cancer from CT scans. We show how three expert radiologists and a state-of-the-art deep learning AI are highly susceptible to the attack. We also explore the attack surface of a modern radiology network and demonstrate one attack vector: we intercepted and manipulated CT scans in an active hospital network with a covert penetration test.},

Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that Tensor-Flow achieves for several real-world applications.},

This allows to focus memory allocation and computation to the relevant dense regions and enables deeper networks without compromising resolution. We demonstrate the utility of our OctNet representation by analyzing the impact of resolution on several 3D tasks including 3D object classification, orientation estimation and point cloud labeling.},

We also discuss first submissions to the benchmark that use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a work horse, which already show remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art. CNNs have become the de-facto standard for many tasks in computer vision and machine learning like semantic segmentation or object detection in images, but have no yet led to a true breakthrough for 3D point cloud labelling tasks due to lack of training data. With the massive data set presented in this paper, we aim at closing this data gap to help unleash the full potential of deep learning methods for 3D labelling tasks. Our semantic3D.net data set consists of dense point clouds acquired with static terrestrial laser scanners. It contains 8 semantic classes and covers a wide range of urban outdoor scenes: churches, streets, railroad tracks, squares, villages, soccer fields and castles. We describe our labelling interface and show that our data set provides more dense and complete point clouds with much higher overall number of labelled points compared to those already available to the research community. We further provide baseline method descriptions and comparison between methods submitted to our online system. We hope semantic3D.net will pave the way for deep learning methods in 3D point cloud labelling to learn richer, more general 3D representations, and first submissions after only a few months indicate that this might indeed be the case.},

abstract = {Learning good feature embeddings for images often requires substantial training data. As a consequence, in settings where training data is limited (e.g., few-shot and zero-shot learning), we are typically forced to use a general feature embedding across prediction tasks. Ideally, we would like to construct feature embeddings that are tuned for the given task and even input image. In this work, we propose Task Aware Feature Embedding Networks (TAFE-Nets) to learn how to adapt the image representation to a new task in a meta learning fashion. Our network is composed of a meta learner and a prediction network, where the meta learner generates parameters for the feature layers in the prediction network based on a task input so that the feature embedding can be accurately adjusted for that task. We show that TAFE-Net is highly effective in generalizing to new tasks or concepts and evaluate the TAFE-Net on a range of benchmarks in zero-shot and few-shot learning. Our model matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art on all tasks. In particular, our approach improves the prediction accuracy of unseen attribute-object pairs by 4 to 15 points on the challenging visual attribute-object composition task.},

abstract = {Deep learning-based medical image registration and segmentation joint models utilize the complementarity (augmentation data or weakly supervised data from registration, region constraints from segmentation) to bring mutual improvement in complex scene and few-shot situation. However, further adoption of the joint models are hindered: 1) the diversity of augmentation data is reduced limiting the further enhancement of segmentation, 2) misaligned regions in weakly supervised data disturb the training process, 3) lack of label-based region constraints in few-shot situation limits the registration performance. We propose a novel Deep Complementary Joint Model (DeepRS) for complex scene registration and few-shot segmentation. We embed a perturbation factor in the registration to increase the activity of deformation thus maintaining the augmentation data diversity. We take a pixel-wise discriminator to extract alignment confidence maps which highlight aligned regions in weakly supervised data so the misaligned regions' disturbance will be suppressed via weighting. The outputs from segmentation model are utilized to implement deep-based region constraints thus relieving the label requirements and bringing fine registration. Extensive experiments on the CT dataset of MM-WHS 2017 Challenge[42] show great advantages of our DeepRS that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models.},

DeepLung consists of two components, nodule detection (identifying the locations of candidate nodules) and classification (classifying candidate nodules into benign or malignant). Considering the 3D nature of lung CT data and the compactness of dual path networks (DPN), two deep 3D DPN are designed for nodule detection and classification respectively. Specifically, a 3D Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Net (R-CNN) is designed for nodule detection with 3D dual path blocks and a U-net-like encoder-decoder structure to effectively learn nodule features. For nodule classification, gradient boosting machine (GBM) with 3D dual path network features is proposed. The nodule classification subnetwork was validated on a public dataset from LIDC-IDRI, on which it achieved better performance than state-of-the-art approaches and surpassed the performance of experienced doctors based on image modality. Within the DeepLung system, candidate nodules are detected first by the nodule detection subnetwork, and nodule diagnosis is conducted by the classification subnetwork. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DeepLung has performance comparable to experienced doctors both for the nodule-level and patient-level diagnosis on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.},

We introduce a probabilistic meta-learning model for domain generalization, in which classifier parameters shared across domains are modeled as distributions. This enables better handling of prediction uncertainty on unseen domains. To deal with domain shift, we learn domain-invariant representations by the proposed principle of meta variational information bottleneck, we call MetaVIB. MetaVIB is derived from novel variational bounds of mutual information, by leveraging the meta-learning setting of domain generalization. Through episodic training, MetaVIB learns to gradually narrow domain gaps to establish domain-invariant representations, while simultaneously maximizing prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks for cross-domain visual recognition. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the benefits of MetaVIB for domain generalization. The comparison results demonstrate our method outperforms previous approaches consistently.},

abstract = {Tumor classification and segmentation are two important tasks for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) images. However, they are challenging due to the significant shape variation of breast tumors and the fuzzy nature of ultrasound images (e.g., low contrast and signal to noise ratio). Considering the correlation between tumor classification and segmentation, we argue that learning these two tasks jointly is able to improve the outcomes of both tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework for joint segmentation and classification of tumors in ABUS images. The proposed framework consists of two sub-networks: an encoder-decoder network for segmentation and a light-weight multi-scale network for classification. To account for the fuzzy boundaries of tumors in ABUS images, our framework uses an iterative training strategy to refine feature maps with the help of probability maps obtained from previous iterations. Experimental results based on a clinical dataset of 170 3D ABUS volumes collected from 107 patients indicate that the proposed multi-task framework improves tumor segmentation and classification over the single-task learning counterparts.},

Apart from category recognition, recovering full 3D shapes from view-based 2.5D depth maps is also a critical part of visual understanding. To this end, we propose to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a Convolutional Deep Belief Network. Our model, 3D ShapeNets, learns the distribution of complex 3D shapes across different object categories and arbitrary poses from raw CAD data, and discovers hierarchical compositional part representation automatically. It naturally supports joint object recognition and shape completion from 2.5D depth maps, and it enables active object recognition through view planning. To train our 3D deep learning model, we construct ModelNet - a large-scale 3D CAD model dataset. Extensive experiments show that our 3D deep representation enables significant performance improvement over the-state-of-the-arts in a variety of tasks.},

abstract = {Plasma cell segmentation is the first stage of a computer assisted automated diagnostic tool for multiple myeloma (MM). Owing to large variability in biological cell types, a method for one cell type cannot be applied directly on the other cell types. In this paper, we present PCSeg Tool for plasma cell segmentation from microscopic medical images. These images were captured from bone marrow aspirate slides of patients with MM. PCSeg has a robust pipeline consisting of a pre-processing step, the proposed modified multiphase level set method followed by post-processing steps including the watershed and circular Hough transform to segment clusters of cells of interest and to remove unwanted cells. Our modified level set method utilizes prior information about the probability densities of regions of interest (ROIs) in the color spaces and provides a solution to the minimal-partition problem to segment ROIs in one of the level sets of a two-phase level set formulation. PCSeg tool is tested on a number of microscopic images and provides good segmentation results on single cells as well as efficient segmentation of plasma cell clusters.},

abstract = {The annotated medical images are usually expensive to be collected. This paper proposes a deep learning method on small data to classify Common Imaging Signs of Lung diseases (CISL) in computed tomography (CT) images. We explore both the real data and the data generated by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to improve the reliability and the generalization of learning. First, we use GAN to generate a large number of CISLs from small annotated data, which are difficult to be distinguished from real counterparts. These generated samples are used to pre-train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying CISLs. Second, we fine-tune the CNN classification model with real data. Experiments were conducted on the LISS database of CISLs. We successfully convinced radiologists that our generated CISLs samples were real for 56.7{\%} of our experiments. The pre-trained CNN model achieves 88.4{\%} of mean accuracy of binary classification, and after fine-tuning, the mean accuracy is significantly increased to 95.0{\%}. For multi-classification of all types of CISLs and normal tissues, through the two stages of training, the mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are up to about 91.83{\%}, 92.73{\%} and 99.0{\%}, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the best result achieved on the LISS database, which demonstrates that the proposed method is effective and promising for fulfilling deep learning on small data.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: Medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention problems are increasingly being addressed with deep-learning-based solutions. Established deep-learning platforms are flexible but do not provide specific functionality for medical image analysis and adapting them for this domain of application requires substantial implementation effort. Consequently, there has been substantial duplication of effort and incompatible infrastructure developed across many research groups. This work presents the open-source NiftyNet platform for deep learning in medical imaging. The ambition of NiftyNet is to accelerate and simplify the development of these solutions, and to provide a common mechanism for disseminating research outputs for the community to use, adapt and build upon. Methods: The NiftyNet infrastructure provides a modular deep-learning pipeline for a range of medical imaging applications including segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications. Components of the NiftyNet pipeline including data loading, data augmentation, network architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics are tailored to, and take advantage of, the idiosyncracies of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention. NiftyNet is built on the TensorFlow framework and supports features such as TensorBoard visualization of 2D and 3D images and computational graphs by default. Results: We present three illustrative medical image analysis applications built using NiftyNet infrastructure: (1) segmentation of multiple abdominal organs from computed tomography; (2) image regression to predict computed tomography attenuation maps from brain magnetic resonance images; and (3) generation of simulated ultrasound images for specified anatomical poses. Conclusions: The NiftyNet infrastructure enables researchers to rapidly develop and distribute deep learning solutions for segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications, or extend the platform to new applications.},

abstract = {We present O-CNN, an Octree-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 3D shape analysis. Built upon the octree representation of 3D shapes, our method takes the average normal vectors of a 3D model sampled in the finest leaf octants as input and performs 3D CNN operations on the octants occupied by the 3D shape surface. We design a novel octree data structure to efficiently store the octant information and CNN features into the graphics memory and execute the entire O-CNN training and evaluation on the GPU. O-CNN supports various CNN structures and works for 3D shapes in different representations. By restraining the computations on the octants occupied by 3D surfaces, the memory and computational costs of the O-CNN grow quadratically as the depth of the octree increases, which makes the 3D CNN feasible for high-resolution 3D models. We compare the performance of the O-CNN with other existing 3D CNN solutions and demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of O-CNN in three shape analysis tasks, including object classification, shape retrieval, and shape segmentation.},

abstract = {Purpose To develop an automated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parotid segmentation method to monitor radiation-induced parotid gland changes in patients after head and neck radiation therapy (RT).
Methods and Materials The proposed method combines the atlas registration method, which captures the global variation of anatomy, with a machine learning technology, which captures the local statistical features, to automatically segment the parotid glands from the MRIs. The segmentation method consists of 3 major steps. First, an atlas (pre-RT MRI and manually contoured parotid gland mask) is built for each patient. A hybrid deformable image registration is used to map the pre-RT MRI to the post-RT MRI, and the transformation is applied to the pre-RT parotid volume. Second, the kernel support vector machine (SVM) is trained with the subject-specific atlas pair consisting of multiple features (intensity, gradient, and others) from the aligned pre-RT MRI and the transformed parotid volume. Third, the well-trained kernel SVM is used to differentiate the parotid from surrounding tissues in the post-RT MRIs by statistically matching multiple texture features. A longitudinal study of 15 patients undergoing head and neck RT was conducted: baseline MRI was acquired prior to RT, and the post-RT MRIs were acquired at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up examinations. The resulting segmentations were compared with the physicians' manual contours.
Results Successful parotid segmentation was achieved for all 15 patients (42 post-RT MRIs). The average percentage of volume differences between the automated segmentations and those of the physicians' manual contours were 7.98{\%} for the left parotid and 8.12{\%} for the right parotid. The average volume overlap was 91.1{\%} ± 1.6{\%} for the left parotid and 90.5{\%} ± 2.4{\%} for the right parotid. The parotid gland volume reduction at follow-up was 25{\%} at 3 months, 27{\%} at 6 months, and 16{\%} at 12 months.
Conclusions We have validated our automated parotid segmentation algorithm in a longitudinal study. This segmentation method may be useful in future studies to address radiation-induced xerostomia in head and neck radiation therapy.},

abstract = {Perceptual experience consists of an enormous number of possible states. Previous fMRI studies have predicted a perceptual state by classifying brain activity into prespecified categories. Constraint-free visual image reconstruction is more challenging, as it is impractical to specify brain activity for all possible images. In this study, we reconstructed visual images by combining local image bases of multiple scales, whose contrasts were independently decoded from fMRI activity by automatically selecting relevant voxels and exploiting their correlated patterns. Binary-contrast, 10 × 10-patch images (2100 possible states) were accurately reconstructed without any image prior on a single trial or volume basis by measuring brain activity only for several hundred random images. Reconstruction was also used to identify the presented image among millions of candidates. The results suggest that our approach provides an effective means to read out complex perceptual states from brain activity while discovering information representation in multivoxel patterns. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Few-shot learning is an almost unexplored area in the field of medical image analysis. We propose a method for few-shot diagnosis of diseases and conditions from chest x-rays using discriminative ensemble learning. Our design involves a CNN-based coarse-learner in the first step to learn the general characteristics of chest x-rays. In the second step, we introduce a saliency-based classifier to extract disease-specific salient features from the output of the coarse-learner and classify based on the salient features. We propose a novel discriminative autoencoder ensemble to design the saliency-based classifier. The classification of the diseases is performed based on the salient features. Our algorithm proceeds through meta-training and meta-testing. During the training phase of meta-training, we train the coarse-learner. However, during the training phase of meta-testing, we train only the saliency-based classifier. Thus, our method is first-of-its-kind where the training phase of meta-training and the training phase of meta-testing are architecturally disjoint, making the method modular and easily adaptable to new tasks requiring the training of only the saliency-based classifier. Experiments show as high as ∼19{\%} improvement in terms of F1 score compared to the baseline in the diagnosis of chest x-rays from publicly available datasets.},

abstract = {Though a large body of computer vision research has investigated developing generic semantic representations, efforts towards developing a similar representation for 3D has been limited. In this paper, we learn a generic 3D representation through solving a set of foundational proxy 3D tasks: object-centric camera pose estimation and wide baseline feature matching. Our method is based upon the premise that by providing supervision over a set of carefully selected foundational tasks, generalization to novel tasks and abstraction capabilities can be achieved. We empirically show that the internal representation of a multi-task ConvNet trained to solve the above core problems generalizes to novel 3D tasks (e.g., scene layout estimation, object pose estimation, surface normal estimation) without the need for fine-tuning and shows traits of abstraction abilities (e.g., cross modality pose estimation). In the context of the core supervised tasks, we demonstrate our representation achieves state-of-the-art wide baseline feature matching results without requiring apriori rectification (unlike SIFT and the majority of learnt features).We also show 6DOF camera pose estimation given a pair local image patches. The accuracy of both supervised tasks come comparable to humans. Finally, we contribute a large-scale dataset composed of object-centric street view scenes along with point correspondences and camera pose information, and conclude with a discussion on the learned representation and open research questions.},

However, when used for classification, it requires large labeled datasets, which are not always available in practice. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised meta-learning algorithm that learns from an unlabeled dataset and adapts to downstream human-specific tasks with few labeled data. The proposed algorithm constructs tasks using clustering embedding methods and data augmentation functions to satisfy two critical class distinction requirements. To alleviate the biases and the weak diversity problem introduced by data augmentation functions, the proposed algorithm uses two methods, which are shifting the feeding data between the inner-outer loops and a novel data augmentation function. We further provide theoretical analysis of the effect of augmentation data in the inner/outer loop. Experiments on the MiniImagenet and Omniglot datasets demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised meta-learning approach outperforms other tested unsupervised representation learning approaches and two recent unsupervised meta-learning baselines. Compared with supervised meta-learning approaches, certain results produced by our method are quite close to those produced by such methods trained on the human-designed labeled tasks.},

The differ- ence, we believe, lies in a proper and methodical approach to thesis/dissertation writing. Right from the beginning of the research project, one must be clear with the topic, the objectives, and the methods. While choosing a topic, one must keep in mind several factors such as the appropriateness, the feasibility, and, above all, one's interest in that particular area. The importance of securing clearances from the appropriate monitoring bodies at the correct time cannot be stressed enough. This exercise also gives the students an invaluable opportunity to learn various aspects of statistics, and this will go a long way in their future careers.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a model for controllable synthesis of 3D (volumetric) medical image data. The model is comprised of three components which are learnt simultaneously from unlabelled data through self-supervision: (i) a multi-tissue anatomical model, (ii) a probability distribution over deformations of this anatomical model, and, (iii) a probability distribution over ‘renderings' of the anatomical model (where a rendering defines the relationship between anatomy and resulting pixel intensities). After training, synthetic data can be generated by sampling the deformation and rendering distributions. To encourage meaningful correspondence in the learnt anatomical model the renderer is kept simple during training, however once trained the (deformed) anatomical model provides dense multi-class segmentation masks for all training volumes, which can be used directly for state-of-the-art conditional image synthesis. This factored model based approach to data synthesis has a number of advantages: Firstly, it allows for coherent synthesis of realistic 3D data, as it is only necessary to learn low dimensional generative models (over deformations and renderings) rather than over the high dimensional 3D images themselves. Secondly, as a by-product of the anatomical model we implicitly learn a dense correspondence between all training volumes, which can be used for registration, or one-shot segmentation (through label transfer). Lastly, the factored representation allows for modality transfer (rendering one image in the modality of another), and meaningful interpolation between volumes. We demonstrate the proposed approach on cardiac MR, and multi-modal abdominal MR/CT datasets.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care. Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.},

abstract = {Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) involve several abnormal imaging patterns observed in computed tomography (CT) images. Accurate classification of these patterns plays a significant role in precise clinical decision making of the extent and nature of the diseases. Therefore, it is important for developing automated pulmonary computer-aided detection systems. Conventionally, this task relies on experts' manual identification of regions of interest (ROIs) as a prerequisite to diagnose potential diseases. This protocol is time consuming and inhibits fully automatic assessment. In this paper, we present a new method to classify ILD imaging patterns on CT images. The main difference is that the proposed algorithm uses the entire image as a holistic input. By circumventing the prerequisite of manual input ROIs, our problem set-up is significantly more difficult than previous work but can better address the clinical workflow. Qualitative and quantitative results using a publicly available ILD database demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy under the patch-based classification and shows the potential of predicting the ILD type using holistic image.},

@article{Kavur2020,
abstract = {Segmentation of abdominal organs has been a comprehensive, yet unresolved, research field for many years. In the last decade, intensive developments in deep learning (DL) introduced new state-of-the-art segmentation systems. Despite outperforming the overall accuracy of existing systems, the effects of DL model properties and parameters on the performance are hard to interpret. This makes comparative analysis a necessary tool towards interpretable studies and systems. Moreover, the performance of DL for emerging learning approaches such as cross-modality and multi-modal semantic segmentation tasks has been rarely discussed. In order to expand the knowledge on these topics, the CHAOS – Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation challenge was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2019, in Venice, Italy. Abdominal organ segmentation from routine acquisitions plays an important role in several clinical applications, such as pre-surgical planning or morphological and volumetric follow-ups for various diseases. These applications require a certain level of performance on a diverse set of metrics such as maximum symmetric surface distance (MSSD) to determine surgical error-margin or overlap errors for tracking size and shape differences. Previous abdomen related challenges are mainly focused on tumor/lesion detection and/or classification with a single modality. Conversely, CHAOS provides both abdominal CT and MR data from healthy subjects for single and multiple abdominal organ segmentation. Five different but complementary tasks were designed to analyze the capabilities of participating approaches from multiple perspectives. The results were investigated thoroughly, compared with manual annotations and interactive methods. The analysis shows that the performance of DL models for single modality (CT / MR) can show reliable volumetric analysis performance (DICE: 0.98 ± 0.00 / 0.95 ± 0.01), but the best MSSD performance remains limited (21.89 ± 13.94 / 20.85 ± 10.63 mm). The performances of participating models decrease dramatically for cross-modality tasks both for the liver (DICE: 0.88 ± 0.15 MSSD: 36.33 ± 21.97 mm). Despite contrary examples on different applications, multi-tasking DL models designed to segment all organs are observed to perform worse compared to organ-specific ones (performance drop around 5{\%}). Nevertheless, some of the successful models show better performance with their multi-organ versions. We conclude that the exploration of those pros and cons in both single vs multi-organ and cross-modality segmentations is poised to have an impact on further research for developing effective algorithms that would support real-world clinical applications. Finally, having more than 1500 participants and receiving more than 550 submissions, another important contribution of this study is the analysis on shortcomings of challenge organizations such as the effects of multiple submissions and peeking phenomenon.},

However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.},

@article{Dugre2019,
abstract = {Objective: It has long been assumed that paranoid ideation may stem from an aberrant limbic response to threatening stimuli. However, results from functional neuroimaging studies using negative emotional stimuli have failed to confirm this assumption. One of the potential reasons for the lack of effect is that study participants with psychosis may display aberrant brain responses to neutral material rather than to threatening stimuli. The authors conducted a functional neuroimaging meta-analysis to test this hypothesis. Methods: A literature search was performed with PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase to identify functional neuroimaging studies examining brain responses to neutral material in patients with psychosis. A total of 23 studies involving schizophrenia patients were retrieved. Using t-maps of peak coordinates to calculate effect sizes, a random-effects model meta-analysis was performed with the anisotropic effect-size version of Seed-based d Mapping software. Results: In schizophrenia patients relative to healthy control subjects, increased activations were observed in the left and right amygdala and parahippocampus and the left putamen, hippocampus, and insula in response to neutral stimuli. Conclusions: Given that several limbic regions were found to be more activated in schizophrenia patients than in control subjects, the results of this meta-analysis strongly suggest that these patients confer aberrant emotional significance to nonthreatening stimuli. In theory, this abnormal brain reactivity may fuel delusional thoughts. Studies are needed in individuals at risk of psychosis to determine whether aberrant limbic reactivity to neutral stimuli is an early neurofunctional marker of psychosis vulnerability.},

Openly available and user friendly tools for the flexible generation of tailor-made datasets for the specific tasks at hand can greatly facilitate the work of researchers around the world.
Methods: We present an open-source framework, Fiberfox, that enables (1) the intuitive definition of arbitrary artificial white matter fiber tracts, (2) signal generation from those fibers by means of the most recent multi-compartment modeling techniques, and (3) simulation of the actual MR acquisition that allows for the introduction of realistic MRI-related effects into the final image.
Results: We show that real acquisitions can be closely approximated by simulating the acquisition of the well-known FiberCup phantom. We further demonstrate the advantages of our framework by evaluating the effects of imaging artifacts and acquisition settings on the outcome of 12 tractography algorithms.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that experiments on a realistic software phantom might change the conclusions drawn from earlier hardware phantom experiments. Fiberfox may find application in validating and further developing methods such as tractography, super-resolution, diffusion modeling or artifact correction.},

CC-359 is comprised of 359 datasets, approximately 60 subjects per vendor and magnetic field strength.

To illustrate the utility of this dataset, we compared to the results of a supervised classifier, the results of eight publicly available skull stripping methods and one publicly available consensus algorithm.

abstract = {Background: The presence of lymph node metastases is one of the most important factors in breast cancer prognosis. The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results: We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells.

abstract = {Nuclear segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images can enable extraction of high-quality features for nuclear morphometrics and other analysis in computational pathology. Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other HE-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a computer aided detection (CAD) system for automated measurement of the fetal head circumference (HC) in 2D ultrasound images for all trimesters of the pregnancy. The HC can be used to estimate the gestational age and monitor growth of the fetus. Automated HC assessment could be valuable in developing countries, where there is a severe shortage of trained sonographers. The CAD system consists of two steps: First, Haar-like features were computed from the ultrasound images to train a random forest classifier to locate the fetal skull. Secondly, the HC was extracted using Hough transform, dynamic programming and an ellipse fit. The CAD system was trained on 999 images and validated on an independent test set of 335 images from all trimesters. The test set was manually annotated by an experienced sonographer and a medical researcher. The reference gestational age (GA) was estimated using the crown-rump length measurement (CRL). The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the experienced sonographer was 0.8 ± 2.6, −0.0 ± 4.6 and 1.9 ± 11.0 days for the first, second and third trimester, respectively. The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the medical researcher was 1.6 ± 2.7, 2.0 ± 4.8 and 3.9 ± 13.7 days. The mean difference between the reference GA and the GA estimated by the CAD system was 0.6 ± 4.3, 0.4 ± 4.7 and 2.5 ± 12.4 days. The results show that the CAD system performs comparable to an experienced sonographer. The presented system shows similar or superior results compared to systems published in literature. This is the first automated system for HC assessment evaluated on a large test set which contained data of all trimesters of the pregnancy.},

@article{Couinaud1999,
abstract = {Background/Aims: In liver anatomy and surgery, is portal and hepatic vein segmentation (French segmentation) to be preferred over arteriobiliary segmentation (Healey and Schroy, North American segmentation)? Methods: Several embryological arguments and an analysis of anatomical data from a personal collection of 110 vasculobiliary casts were made. Results: Embryological arguments: Portal vein branching appears first, arteriobiliary branching secondly follows the portal vein distribution. Segment II (the left lateral sector) is the development of the right lateral embryological lobe. The umbilical vein enters the left portion of the middle embryological lobe, forming segment IV on the right and segment III on the left: this is the left paramedian sector. So the left portal fissure (between left and middle lobes) transversally crosses the classical left lobe, which is not a portal unit. Segment VI is a late secondary prominence of segment VII, reaching the anterior margin of the liver only in man. Anatomical arguments: hepatic vein segmentation must be added to portal segmentation; the academic left lobe is the left hepatic vein sector, and the left hepatic fissure separates the classical right and left lobes. Portal vein segmentation must be preferred: portal vein duplication of branches of first order occurs only in 23.5 of the cases, while arteriobiliary duplication of first-order branches is noted in 50 of the livers, portal segmentation being much simpler. Conclusions: Portal and hepatic vein segmentation seems to be much more accurate. Copyright (C) 1999 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Video processing and understanding can be used to empower computer assisted interventions (CAI) as well as the development of detailed post-operative analysis of the surgical intervention. A fundamental building block to such capabilities is the ability to understand and segment video into semantic labels that differentiate and localize tissue types and different instruments. Deep learning has advanced semantic segmentation techniques dramatically in recent years but is fundamentally reliant on the availability of labelled datasets used to train models. In this paper, we introduce a high quality dataset for semantic segmentation in Cataract surgery. We generated this dataset from the CATARACTS challenge dataset, which is publicly available. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset has the highest quality annotation in surgical data to date. We introduce the dataset and then show the automatic segmentation performance of state-of-the-art models on that dataset as a benchmark.},

The main idea is to treat one-shot segmentation as a classical atlas-based segmentation problem, where voxel-wise correspondence from the atlas to the unlabelled data is learned. Subsequently, segmentation label of the atlas can be transferred to the unlabelled data with the learned correspondence. However, since ground truth correspondence between images is usually unavailable, the learning system must be well-supervised to avoid mode collapse and convergence failure. To overcome this difficulty, we resort to the forward-backward consistency, which is widely used in correspondence problems, and additionally learn the backward correspondences from the warped atlases back to the original atlas. This cycle-correspondence learning design enables a variety of extra, cycle-consistency-based supervision signals to make the training process stable, while also boost the performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over both deep learning-based one-shot segmentation methods and a classical multi-atlas segmentation method via thorough experiments.},

However, sufficiently labeled data are indispensable for extracting intertask relationships before transferring knowledge in classical supervised LML systems. Inadequate labels may deteriorate the performance due to the poor initial approximation. In order to extend the typical LML system, we propose a novel hierarchical lifelong learning algorithm (HLLA) consisting of two following layers: 1) the knowledge layer consisted of shared representations and integrated knowledge basis at the bottom and 2) parameterized hypothesis functions with features at the top. Unlabeled data is leveraged in HLLA for pretraining of the shared representations. We also have considered a selective inherited updating method to deal with intertask distribution shifting. Experiments show that our HLLA method outperforms many other recent LML algorithms, especially when dealing with higher dimensional, lower correlation, and fewer labeled data problems.},

Gold standard labeling of these sub-regions in radiographic imaging is essential for both clinical and computational studies, including radiomic and radiogenomic analyses. Towards this end, we release segmentation labels and radiomic features for all pre-operative multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=243) of the multi-institutional glioma collections of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), publicly available in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Pre-operative scans were identified in both glioblastoma (TCGA-GBM, n=135) and low-grade-glioma (TCGA-LGG, n=108) collections via radiological assessment. The glioma sub-region labels were produced by an automated state-of-the-art method and manually revised by an expert board-certified neuroradiologist. An extensive panel of radiomic features was extracted based on the manually-revised labels. This set of labels and features should enable i) direct utilization of the TCGA/TCIA glioma collections towards repeatable, reproducible and comparative quantitative studies leading to new predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic assessments, as well as ii) performance evaluation of computer-aided segmentation methods, and comparison to our state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {Receiving timely and appropriate treatment is crucial for better health outcomes, and research on the contribution of specific variables is essential. In the mental health domain, an important research variable is the date of psychosis symptom onset, as longer delays in treatment are associated with worse intervention outcomes. The growing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) within mental health services provides an invaluable opportunity to study this problem at scale retrospectively. However, disease onset information is often only available in open text fields, requiring natural language processing (NLP) techniques for automated analyses. Since this variable can be documented at different points during a patient's care, NLP methods that model clinical and temporal associations are needed. We address the identification of psychosis onset by: 1) manually annotating a corpus of mental health EHRs with disease onset mentions, 2) modelling the underlying NLP problem as a paragraph classification approach, and 3) combining multiple onset paragraphs at the patient level to generate a ranked list of likely disease onset dates. For 22/31 test patients (71{\%}) the correct onset date was found among the top-3 NLP predictions. The proposed approach was also applied at scale, allowing an onset date to be estimated for 2483 patients.},

abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the future challenges of meeting care demands for the growing number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States with a particular emphasis on primary care. By mid-century, the number of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia may grow to 13.8 million. This represents a steep increase from the estimated 5.8 million Americans age 65 and older who have Alzheimer's dementia today. Official death certificates recorded 122,019 deaths from AD in 2018, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2018, deaths resulting from stroke, HIV and heart disease decreased, whereas reported deaths from Alzheimer's increased 146.2{\%}. In 2019, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.6 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at nearly {\$}244 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2020 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be {\$}305 billion. As the population of Americans living with Alzheimer's dementia increases, the burden of caring for that population also increases. These challenges are exacerbated by a shortage of dementia care specialists, which places an increasing burden on primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide care for people living with dementia. Many PCPs feel underprepared and inadequately trained to handle dementia care responsibilities effectively. This report includes recommendations for maximizing quality care in the face of the shortage of specialists and training challenges in primary care.},

abstract = {Neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) of breast cancer (BCa) is an option for patients with the locally advanced disease. It has been compared with standard adjuvant therapy with the aim of improving prognosis and surgical outcome. Moreover, the response of the tumor to the therapy provides useful information for patient management. The pathological examination of the tissue sections after surgery is the gold-standard to estimate the residual tumor and the assessment of cellularity is an important component of tumor burden assessment. In the current clinical practice, tumor cellularity is manually estimated by pathologists on hematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) stained slides, the quality, and reliability of which might be impaired by inter-observer variability which potentially affects prognostic power assessment in NAT trials. This procedure is also qualitative and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a method of automatically assessing cellularity. A pipeline to automatically segment nuclei figures and estimate residual cancer cellularity from within patches and whole slide images (WSIs) of BCa was developed. We have compared the performance of our proposed pipeline in estimating residual cancer cellularity with that of two expert pathologists. We found an intra-class agreement coefficient (ICC) of 0.89 (95{\%} CI of [0.70, 0.95]) between pathologists, 0.74 (95{\%} CI of [0.70, 0.77]) between pathologist {\#}1 and proposed method, and 0.75 (95{\%} CI of [0.71, 0.79]) between pathologist {\#}2 and proposed method. We have also successfully applied our proposed technique on a WSI to locate areas with high concentration of residual cancer. The main advantage of our approach is that it is fully automatic and can be used to find areas with high cellularity in WSIs. This provides a first step in developing an automatic technique for post-NAT tumor response assessment from pathology slides. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often through extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently releam their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-based focusing mechanisms.},

abstract = {As one of the most common human helminths, hookworm is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity, which seriously threatens human health. Recently, wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has been applied to automatic hookworm detection. Unfortunately, it remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated impressive performance in various image and video analysis tasks. In this paper, a novel deep hookworm detection framework is proposed for WCE images, which simultaneously models visual appearances and tubular patterns of hookworms. This is the first deep learning framework specifically designed for hookworm detection in WCE images. Two CNN networks, namely edge extraction network and hookworm classification network, are seamlessly integrated in the proposed framework, which avoid the edge feature caching and speed up the classification. Two edge pooling layers are introduced to integrate the tubular regions induced from edge extraction network and the feature maps from hookworm classification network, leading to enhanced feature maps emphasizing the tubular regions. Experiments have been conducted on one of the largest WCE datasets with 440K WCE images, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hookworm detection framework. It significantly outperforms the state-of-The-Art approaches. The high sensitivity and accuracy of the proposed method in detecting hookworms shows its potential for clinical application.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for active learning on medical image data. Although deep learning has achieved great success on medical image processing, it relies on a large number of labeled data for training, which is expensive and time-consuming. Active learning, which follows a strategy to select and annotate informative samples, is an effective approach to alleviate this issue. However, most existing methods of active learning adopt a hand-design strategy, which cannot handle the dynamic procedure of classifier training. To address this issue, we model the procedure of active learning as a Markov decision process, and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a dynamic policy for active learning. To achieve this, we employ the actor-critic approach, and apply the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to train the model. We conduct experiments on two kinds of medical image data sets, and the results demonstrate that our method is able to learn better strategy compared with the existing hand-design ones.},

abstract = {Recent studies on mobile network design have demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of channel attention (e.g., the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention) for lifting model performance, but they generally neglect the positional information, which is important for generating spatially selective attention maps. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call "coordinate attention". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet classification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

abstract = {Background: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often demonstrate varying clinical courses and outcomes, even within the same tumor stage. This study explores deep learning applications in medical imaging allowing for the automated quantification of radiographic characteristics and potentially improving patient stratification. Methods and findings: We performed an integrative analysis on 7 independent datasets across 5 institutions totaling 1,194 NSCLC patients (age median = 68.3 years [range 32.5–93.3], survival median = 1.7 years [range 0.0–11.7]). Using external validation in computed tomography (CT) data, we identified prognostic signatures using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for patients treated with radiotherapy (n = 771, age median = 68.0 years [range 32.5–93.3], survival median = 1.3 years [range 0.0–11.7]). We then employed a transfer learning approach to achieve the same for surgery patients (n = 391, age median = 69.1 years [range 37.2–88.0], survival median = 3.1 years [range 0.0–8.8]). We found that the CNN predictions were significantly associated with 2-year overall survival from the start of respective treatment for radiotherapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.70 [95{\%} CI 0.63–0.78], p {\textless} 0.001) and surgery (AUC = 0.71 [95{\%} CI 0.60–0.82], p {\textless} 0.001) patients. The CNN was also able to significantly stratify patients into low and high mortality risk groups in both the radiotherapy (p {\textless} 0.001) and surgery (p = 0.03) datasets. Additionally, the CNN was found to significantly outperform random forest models built on clinical parameters—including age, sex, and tumor node metastasis stage—as well as demonstrate high robustness against test–retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91) and inter-reader (Spearman's rank-order correlation = 0.88) variations. To gain a better understanding of the characteristics captured by the CNN, we identified regions with the most contribution towards predictions and highlighted the importance of tumor-surrounding tissue in patient stratification. We also present preliminary findings on the biological basis of the captured phenotypes as being linked to cell cycle and transcriptional processes. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study as well as the opaque black box nature of deep learning networks. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that deep learning networks may be used for mortality risk stratification based on standard-of-care CT images from NSCLC patients. This evidence motivates future research into better deciphering the clinical and biological basis of deep learning networks as well as validation in prospective data.},

abstract = {Our objective was to determine whether early change in standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 3′deoxy-3′-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) using PET with CT could predict pathologic complete response (pCR) of primary breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The key secondary objective was to correlate SUV with the proliferation marker Ki-67 at baseline and after NAC Methods: This prospective, multicenter phase II study did not specify the therapeutic regimen, thus, NAC varied among centers. Al evaluable patients underwent 18F-FLT PET/CT at baseline (FLT1) and after 1 cycle of NAC (FLT2); 43 patients were imaged at FLT1, FLT2, and after NAC completion (FLT3). The percentage change in maximum SUV ({\%}DSUVmax) between FLT1 and FLT2 and FLT3 was calculated for the primary tumors. The predictive value of DSUVmax for pCR was determined using receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis. The correlation between SUVmax and Ki-67 was also assessed. Results: Fifty-one of 90 recruited patients (median age, 54 y; stage IIA-IIIC) met the eligibility criteria for the primary objective analysis, with an additional 22 patients totaling 73 patients for secondary analyses. A pCR in the primary breast cancer was achieved in 9 of 51 patients. NAC resulted in a significant reduction in {\%}SUVmax (mean D, 39{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 31-46). There was a marginal difference in {\%}DSUVmax-FLT1-FLT2 between pCR and no-pCR patient groups (Wilcoxon 1 -sided P = 0.050). The area under the curve for DSUVmax in the prediction of pCR was 0.68 (90{\%} confidence interval, 0.50-0.83; Delong 1-sided P = 0.05), with slightly better predictive value for percentage mean SUV (P = 0.02) and similar prediction for peak SUV (P = 0.04). There was a weak correlation with pretherapy SUVmax and Ki-67 (r = 0.29, P = 0.04), but the correlation between SUVmax and Ki-67 after completion of NAC was stronger (r = 0.68, P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusion: 18F-FLT PET imaging of breast cancer after 1 cycle of NAC weakly predicted pCR in the setting of variable NAC regimens. Posttherapy 18F-FLT uptake correlated with Ki-67 on surgical specimens. These results suggest some efficacy of 18F-FLT as an indicator of early therapeutic response of breast cancer to NAC and support future multicenter studies to test 18F-FLT PET in a more uniformly treated patient population.},

Build upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method could build a segmentation model with Flair, T1c, and T2 scans and achieve competitive performance as those built with Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 scans.},

abstract = {Purpose: In radiotherapy, MRI is used for target volume and organs-at-risk delineation for its superior soft-tissue contrast as compared to CT imaging. However, MRI does not provide the electron density of tissue necessary for dose calculation. Several methods of synthetic-CT (sCT) generation from MRI data have been developed for radiotherapy dose calculation. This work reviewed deep learning (DL) sCT generation methods and their associated image and dose evaluation, in the context of MRI-based dose calculation. Methods: We searched the PubMed and ScienceDirect electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2021. For each paper, several items were screened and compiled in figures and tables. Results: This review included 57 studies. The DL methods were either generator-only based (45{\%} of the reviewed studies), or generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture and its variants (55{\%} of the reviewed studies). The brain and pelvis were the most commonly investigated anatomical localizations (39{\%} and 28{\%} of the reviewed studies, respectively), and more rarely, the head-and-neck (H{\&}N) (15{\%}), abdomen (10{\%}), liver (5{\%}) or breast (3{\%}). All the studies performed an image evaluation of sCTs with a diversity of metrics, with only 36 studies performing dosimetric evaluations of sCT. Conclusions: The median mean absolute errors were around 76 HU for the brain and H{\&}N sCTs and 40 HU for the pelvis sCTs. For the brain, the mean dose difference between the sCT and the reference CT was {\textless}2{\%}. For the H{\&}N and pelvis, the mean dose difference was below 1{\%} in most of the studies. Recent GAN architectures have advantages compared to generator-only, but no superiority was found in term of image or dose sCT uncertainties. Key challenges of DL-based sCT generation methods from MRI in radiotherapy is the management of movement for abdominal and thoracic localizations, the standardization of sCT evaluation, and the investigation of multicenter impacts.},

abstract = {Reproducibility verification is essential to the practice of the scientific method. Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification. This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84{\%} code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads.

abstract = {Purpose: Radiation therapy (RT) is a common treatment option for head and neck (HaN) cancer. An important step involved in RT planning is the delineation of organs-at-risks (OARs) based on HaN computed tomography (CT). However, manually delineating OARs is time-consuming as each slice of CT images needs to be individually examined and a typical CT consists of hundreds of slices. Automating OARs segmentation has the benefit of both reducing the time and improving the quality of RT planning. Existing anatomy autosegmentation algorithms use primarily atlas-based methods, which require sophisticated atlas creation and cannot adequately account for anatomy variations among patients. In this work, we propose an end-to-end, atlas-free three-dimensional (3D) convolutional deep learning framework for fast and fully automated whole-volume HaN anatomy segmentation. Methods: Our deep learning model, called AnatomyNet, segments OARs from head and neck CT images in an end-to-end fashion, receiving whole-volume HaN CT images as input and generating masks of all OARs of interest in one shot. AnatomyNet is built upon the popular 3D U-net architecture, but extends it in three important ways: (a) a new encoding scheme to allow autosegmentation on whole-volume CT images instead of local patches or subsets of slices, (b) incorporating 3D squeeze-and-excitation residual blocks in encoding layers for better feature representation, and (c) a new loss function combining Dice scores and focal loss to facilitate the training of the neural model. These features are designed to address two main challenges in deep learning-based HaN segmentation: (a) segmenting small anatomies (i.e., optic chiasm and optic nerves) occupying only a few slices, and (b) training with inconsistent data annotations with missing ground truth for some anatomical structures. Results: We collected 261 HaN CT images to train AnatomyNet and used MICCAI Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge 2015 as a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of AnatomyNet. The objective is to segment nine anatomies: brain stem, chiasm, mandible, optic nerve left, optic nerve right, parotid gland left, parotid gland right, submandibular gland left, and submandibular gland right. Compared to previous state-of-the-art results from the MICCAI 2015 competition, AnatomyNet increases Dice similarity coefficient by 3.3{\%} on average. AnatomyNet takes about 0.12 s to fully segment a head and neck CT image of dimension 178 × 302 × 225, significantly faster than previous methods. In addition, the model is able to process whole-volume CT images and delineate all OARs in one pass, requiring little pre- or postprocessing. Conclusion: Deep learning models offer a feasible solution to the problem of delineating OARs from CT images. We demonstrate that our proposed model can improve segmentation accuracy and simplify the autosegmentation pipeline. With this method, it is possible to delineate OARs of a head and neck CT within a fraction of a second.},

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation. However, analyzing large rehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but are labor intensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the results often lack accuracy. Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet these require large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke), an open-source dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and metadata. This large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion segmentation algorithms and provides a standardized dataset for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS release 1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current lesion segmentation methods.},

Building a highly accurate prediction model for these tasks usually requires a large number of images manually annotated with labels and finding sites of abnormalities. In reality, however, such annotated data are expensive to acquire, especially the ones with location annotations. We need methods that can work well with only a small amount of location annotations. To address this challenge, we present a unified approach that simultaneously performs disease identification and localization through the same underlying model for all images. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively leverage both class information as well as limited location annotation, and significantly outperforms the comparative reference baseline in both classification and localization tasks.},

Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1–3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players.

abstract = {Generalized nucleus segmentation techniques can contribute greatly to reducing the time to develop and validate visual biomarkers for new digital pathology datasets. We summarize the results of MoNuSeg 2018 Challenge whose objective was to develop generalizable nuclei segmentation techniques in digital pathology. The challenge was an official satellite event of the MICCAI 2018 conference in which 32 teams with more than 80 participants from geographically diverse institutes participated. Contestants were given a training set with 30 images from seven organs with annotations of 21,623 individual nuclei. A test dataset with 14 images taken from seven organs, including two organs that did not appear in the training set was released without annotations. Entries were evaluated based on average aggregated Jaccard index (AJI) on the test set to prioritize accurate instance segmentation as opposed to mere semantic segmentation. More than half the teams that completed the challenge outperformed a previous baseline. Among the trends observed that contributed to increased accuracy were the use of color normalization as well as heavy data augmentation. Additionally, fully convolutional networks inspired by variants of U-Net, FCN, and Mask-RCNN were popularly used, typically based on ResNet or VGG base architectures. Watershed segmentation on predicted semantic segmentation maps was a popular post-processing strategy. Several of the top techniques compared favorably to an individual human annotator and can be used with confidence for nuclear morphometrics.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated great achievement in increasing the accuracy and stability of medical image segmentation. However, existing CNNs are limited by the problem of dependency on the availability of training data owing to high manual annotation costs and privacy issues. To counter this limitation, domain adaptation (DA) and few-shot learning have been extensively studied. Inspired by these two categories of approaches, we propose an optimizationbased meta-learning method for segmentation tasks. Even though existing meta-learning methods use prior knowledge to choose parameters that generalize well from few examples, these methods limit the diversity of the task distribution that they can learn from in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to augment the existing algorithms with the capability to learn from diverse segmentation tasks across the entire task distribution. Specifically, our algorithm aims to learn from the diversity of image features which characterize a specific tissue type while showing diverse signal intensities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conducted experiments using a diverse set of segmentation tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon and two meta-learning benchmarks: model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and Reptile. U-Net and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were selected as the baseline model and the main performance metric, respectively. The experimental results show that our algorithm maximally surpasses MAML and Reptile by 2{\%} and 2.4{\%} respectively, in terms of the DSC. By showing a consistent improvement in subjective measures, we can also infer that our algorithm can produce a better generalization of a target task that has few examples.},

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the most widely used techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of FISH to predict LOH at 1p and 19q when performed on touch preparations from 40 oligodendroglial tumors, even if the majority of the nuclei showed chromosomal imbalance. PCR was used as the gold standard. The presence of none or one target signal was reported as FISH-LOH, whereas all other losses were defined as FISH-imbalance. The sum of nuclei with FISH-LOH and imbalance was calculated in each case (FISH-sum) and cut-off values were defined as the mean FISH-sum value in controls plus 3 standard deviations; 27.7{\%} for 1p and 33.2{\%} for 19q. These corresponded well with the optimal cut-off values for our data, calculated using the minimum error rate classification procedure (35.6{\%} for 1p and 33.1{\%} for 19q). Concurrent FISH and PCR results were encountered in 95{\%} for 1p and 87.5{\%} for 19q. FISH-sum was the best and simplest discriminating variable for correct classification of LOH status. Under these conditions, even a dominant population of nuclei showing FISH-imbalance represented an LOH status in the tumor cells. FISH on touch preparations is a quick and reliable method for 1p/19q testing, does not require normal DNA and can be easily performed in an immunohistochemistry unit.

abstract = {The state-of-the-art multitask multiview (MTMV) learning tackles a scenario where multiple tasks are related to each other via multiple shared feature views. However, in many real-world scenarios where a sequence of the multiview task comes, the higher storage requirement and computational cost of retraining previous tasks with MTMV models have presented a formidable challenge for this lifelong learning scenario. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose a new continual multiview task learning model that integrates deep matrix factorization and sparse subspace learning in a unified framework, which is termed deep continual multiview task learning (DCMvTL). More specifically, as a new multiview task arrives, DCMvTL first adopts a deep matrix factorization technique to capture hidden and hierarchical representations for this new coming multiview task while accumulating the fresh multiview knowledge in a layerwise manner. Then, a sparse subspace learning model is employed for the extracted factors at each layer and further reveals cross-view correlations via a self-expressive constraint. For model optimization, we derive a general multiview learning formulation when a new multiview task comes and apply an alternating minimization strategy to achieve lifelong learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DCMvTL model compared with the existing state-of-the-art MTMV and lifelong multiview task learning models.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {Recent research has revealed that the output of deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input vector. In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97{\%} of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04{\%} of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03{\%} and 22.91{\%} confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.},

abstract = {Enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) can provide important information for cancer diagnosis, staging, and measuring treatment reactions, making automated detection a highly sought goal. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm representation of decomposing the LN detection problem into a set of 2D object detection subtasks on sampled CT slices, largely alleviating the curse of dimensionality issue. Our 2D detection can be effectively formulated as linear classification on a single image feature type of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), covering a moderate field-of-view of 45 by 45 voxels. We exploit both max-pooling and sparse linear fusion schemes to aggregate these 2D detection scores for the final 3D LN detection. In this manner, detection is more tractable and does not need to perform perfectly at instance level (as weak hypotheses) since our aggregation process will robustly harness collective information for LN detection. Two datasets (90 patients with 389 mediastinal LNs and 86 patients with 595 abdominal LNs) are used for validation. Cross-validation demonstrates 78.0{\%} sensitivity at 6 false positives/volume (FP/vol.) (86.1{\%} at 10 FP/vol.) and 73.1{\%} sensitivity at 6 FP/vol.

abstract = {PURPOSE We aimed to compare the accuracy and repeatability of emerging machine learning-based (i.e., deep learning) automatic segmentation algorithms with those of well-established interactive semi-automatic methods for determining liver volume in living liver transplant donors at computed tomography (CT) imaging. METHODS A total of 12 methods (6 semi-automatic, 6 full-automatic) were evaluated. The semi-automatic segmentation algorithms were based on both traditional iterative models including watershed, fast marching, region growing, active contours and modern techniques including robust statistics segmenter and super-pixels. These methods entailed some sort of interaction mechanism such as placing initialization seeds on images or determining a parameter range. The automatic methods were based on deep learning and included three framework templates (DeepMedic, NiftyNet and U-Net), the first two of which were applied with default parameter sets and the last two involved adapted novel model designs. For 20 living donors (8 training and 12 test data-sets), a group of imaging scientists and radiologists created ground truths by performing manual segmentations on contrast-enhanced CT images. Each segmentation was evaluated using five metrics (i.e., volume overlap and relative volume errors, average/root-mean-square/maximum symmetrical surface distances). The results were mapped to a scoring system and a final grade was calculated by taking their average. Accuracy and repeatability were evaluated using slice-by-slice comparisons and volumetric analysis. Diversity and complementarity were observed through heatmaps. Majority voting (MV) and simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) algorithms were utilized to obtain the fusion of the individual results. RESULTS The top four methods were automatic deep learning models, with scores of 79.63, 79.46, 77.15, and 74.50. Intra-user score was determined as 95.14. Overall, automatic deep learning segmentation outperformed interactive techniques on all metrics. The mean volume of liver of ground truth was 1409.93±271.28 mL, while it was calculated as 1342.21±231.24 mL using automatic and 1201.26±258.13 mL using interactive methods, showing higher accuracy and less variation with automatic methods. The qualitative analysis of segmentation results showed significant diversity and complementarity, enabling the idea of using ensembles to obtain superior results. The fusion score of automatic methods reached 83.87 with MV and 86.20 with STAPLE, which were only slightly less than fusion of all methods (MV, 86.70) and (STAPLE, 88.74). CONCLUSION Use of the new deep learning-based automatic segmentation algorithms substantially increases the accuracy and repeatability for segmentation and volumetric measurements of liver. Fusion of automatic methods based on ensemble approaches exhibits best results with almost no additional time cost due to potential parallel execution of multiple models.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Optical Society of America. We present a fully automatic algorithm to identify fluid-filled regions and seven retinal layers on spectral domain optical coherence tomography images of eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME). To achieve this, we developed a kernel regression (KR)-based classification method to estimate fluid and retinal layer positions. We then used these classification estimates as a guide to more accurately segment the retinal layer boundaries using our previously described graph theory and dynamic programming (GTDP) framework. We validated our algorithm on 110 Bscans from ten patients with severe DME pathology, showing an overall mean Dice coefficient of 0.78 when comparing our KR + GTDP algorithm to an expert grader. This is comparable to the inter-observer Dice coefficient of 0.79. The entire data set is available online, including our automatic and manual segmentation results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first validated, fully-automated, seven-layer and fluid segmentation method which has been applied to real-world images containing severe DME.},

abstract = {Serving ML prediction pipelines spanning multiple models and hardware accelerators is a key challenge in production machine learning. Optimally configuring these pipelines to meet tight end-to-end latency goals is complicated by the interaction between model batch size, the choice of hardware accelerator, and variation in the query arrival process. In this paper we introduce InferLine, a system which provisions and manages the individual stages of prediction pipelines to meet end-to-end tail latency constraints while minimizing cost. InferLine consists of a low-frequency combinatorial planner and a high-frequency auto-scaling tuner. The low-frequency planner leverages stage-wise profiling, discrete event simulation, and constrained combinatorial search to automatically select hardware type, replication, and batching parameters for each stage in the pipeline. The high-frequency tuner uses network calculus to auto-scale each stage to meet tail latency goals in response to changes in the query arrival process. We demonstrate that InferLine outperforms existing approaches by up to 7.6x in cost while achieving up to 34.5x lower latency SLO miss rate on realistic workloads and generalizes across state-of-the-art model serving frameworks.},

abstract = {We present a simple and general framework for feature learning from point clouds. The key to the success of CNNs is the convolution operator that is capable of leveraging spatially-local correlation in data represented densely in grids (e.g. images). However, point clouds are irregular and unordered, thus directly convolving kernels against features associated with the points will result in desertion of shape information and variance to point ordering. To address these problems, we propose to learn an X-transformation from the input points to simultaneously promote two causes: the first is the weighting of the input features associated with the points, and the second is the permutation of the points into a latent and potentially canonical order. Element-wise product and sum operations of the typical convolution operator are subsequently applied on the X-transformed features. The proposed method is a generalization of typical CNNs to feature learning from point clouds, thus we call it PointCNN. Experiments show that PointCNN achieves on par or better performance than state-of-the-art methods on multiple challenging benchmark datasets and tasks.},

Na{\~{A}}ely applying convolutions on this lattice scales poorly, both in terms of memory and computational cost, as the size of the lattice increases. Instead, our network uses sparse bilateral convolutional layers as building blocks. These layers maintain efficiency by using indexing structures to apply convolutions only on occupied parts of the lattice, and allow flexible specifications of the lattice structure enabling hierarchical and spatially-aware feature learning, as well as joint 2D-3D reasoning. Both point-based and image-based representations can be easily incorporated in a network with such layers and the resulting model can be trained in an end-to-end manner. We present results on 3D segmentation tasks where our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, the extraction of meaningful, qualitative data from the original document is difficult due to the narrative and complex nature of such reports. Keyword extraction for pathology reports is necessary to summarize the informative text and reduce intensive time consumption. In this study, we employed a deep learning model for the natural language process to extract keywords from pathology reports and presented the supervised keyword extraction algorithm. We considered three types of pathological keywords, namely specimen, procedure, and pathology types. We compared the performance of the present algorithm with the conventional keyword extraction methods on the 3115 pathology reports that were manually labeled by professional pathologists. Additionally, we applied the present algorithm to 36,014 unlabeled pathology reports and analysed the extracted keywords with biomedical vocabulary sets. The results demonstrated the suitability of our model for practical application in extracting important data from pathology reports.},

abstract = {In this work, we take a fresh look at some old and new algorithms for off-policy, return-based reinforcement learning. Expressing these in a common form, we derive a novel algorithm, Retrace($\lambda$), with three desired properties: (1) it has low variance; (2) it safely uses samples collected from any behaviour policy, whatever its degree of "off-policyness"; and (3) it is efficient as it makes the best use of samples collected from near on-policy behaviour policies. We analyze the contractive nature of the related operator under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online sample-based algorithms. We believe this is the first return-based off-policy control algorithm converging a.s. to Q∗ without the GLIE assumption (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration). As a corollary, we prove the convergence of Watkins' Q($\lambda$), which was an open problem since 1989. We illustrate the benefits of Retrace($\lambda$) on a standard suite of Atari 2600 games.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease which afflicts the joints with arthritis and periarticular bone destruction as a result. One of its central features is bone erosion, a consequence of excessive bone resorption and insufficient bone formation. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a promising tool for monitoring RA. Quantification of bone erosions and detection of possible progression is essential in the management of treatment. Detection is performed manually and is a very demanding task as rheumatologists must annotate hundreds of 2D images and inspect any region of the bone structure that is suspected to be a sign of RA. We propose a 2D based method which combines an accurate segmentation of bone surface boundary and classification of patches along the surface as healthy or eroded. We use a series of classical image processing methods to segment CT volumes semi-automatically. They are used as training data for a U-Net. We train a Siamese net to learn the difference between healthy and eroded patches. The Siamese net alleviates the problem of highly imbalanced class labels by providing a base for one-shot learning of differences between patches. We trained and tested the method using 3 full HR-pQCT scans with bone erosion of various size. The proposed pipeline succeeded in classifying healthy and eroded patches with high precision and recall. The proposed algorithm is a preliminary work to demonstrate the potential of our pipeline in automating the process of detecting and locating the eroded regions of bone surfaces affected by RA.},

abstract = {Despite generative adversarial networks (GANs) can hallucinate photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution (LR) faces, they cannot guarantee preserving the identities of hallucinated HR faces, making the HR faces poorly recognizable. To address this problem, we propose a Siamese GAN (SiGAN) to reconstruct HR faces that visually resemble their corresponding identities. On top of a Siamese network, the proposed SiGAN consists of a pair of two identical generators and one discriminator. We incorporate reconstruction error and identity label information in the loss function of SiGAN in a pairwise manner. By iteratively optimizing the loss functions of the generator pair and discriminator of SiGAN, we cannot only achieve photo-realistic face reconstruction, but also ensures the reconstructed information is useful for identity recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that SiGAN significantly outperforms existing face hallucination GANs in objective face verification performance, while achieving photo-realistic reconstruction. Moreover, for input LR faces from unknown identities who are not included in training, SiGAN can still do a good job.},

abstract = {Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the challenge of identifying the best ML algorithms for each of these tasks, considering that apart from being diverse on each instance of the challenge, the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuously evolving/growing dataset.},

abstract = {Retinal swelling due to the accumulation of fluid is associated with the most vision-threatening retinal diseases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current standard of care in assessing the presence and quantity of retinal fluid and image-guided treatment management. Deep learning methods have made their impact across medical imaging, and many retinal OCT analysis methods have been proposed. However, it is currently not clear how successful they are in interpreting the retinal fluid on OCT, which is due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this, we organized a challenge RETOUCH in conjunction with MICCAI 2017, with eight teams participating. The challenge consisted of two tasks: fluid detection and fluid segmentation. It featured for the first time: all three retinal fluid types, with annotated images provided by two clinical centers, which were acquired with the three most common OCT device vendors from patients with two different retinal diseases. The analysis revealed that in the detection task, the performance on the automated fluid detection was within the inter-grader variability. However, in the segmentation task, fusing the automated methods produced segmentations that were superior to all individual methods, indicating the need for further improvements in the segmentation performance.},

abstract = {Fully-convolutional neural networks have achieved superior performance in a variety of image segmentation tasks. However, their training requires laborious manual annotation of large datasets, as well as acceleration by parallel processors with high-bandwidth memory, such as GPUs. We show that simple models can achieve competitive accuracy for organ segmentation on CT images when trained with extensive data augmentation, which leverages existing graphics hardware to quickly apply geometric and photometric transformations to 3D image data. On 3 mm3 CT volumes, our GPU implementation is 2.6-8×faster than a widely-used CPU version, including communication overhead. We also show how to automatically generate training labels using rudimentary morphological operations, which are efficiently computed by 3D Fourier transforms. We combined fully-automatic labels for the lungs and bone with semi-automatic ones for the liver, kidneys and bladder, to create a dataset of 130 labeled CT scans. To achieve the best results from data augmentation, our model uses the intersection-over-union (IOU) loss function, a close relative of the Dice loss. We discuss its mathematical properties and explain why it outperforms the usual weighted cross-entropy loss for unbalanced segmentation tasks. We conclude that there is no unique IOU loss function, as the naive one belongs to a broad family of functions with the same essential properties. When combining data augmentation with the IOU loss, our model achieves a Dice score of 78-92{\%} for each organ. The trained model, code and dataset will be made publicly available, to further medical imaging research.},

abstract = {Discrete Fourier transforms provide a significant speedup in the computation of convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its advantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality reduction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strategies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality. This representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by randomized modification of resolution. We show that these methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or max-pooling. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral parameterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model unchanged, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly faster convergence during training.},

abstract = {Image segmentation is one of the most essential biomedical image processing problems for different imaging modalities, including microscopy and X-ray in the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) domain. However, annotating biomedical images is knowledge-driven, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it difficult to obtain abundant labels with limited costs. Active learning strategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a subset of training data for annotation. Despite receiving attention, most of active learning methods generally still require huge computational costs and utilize unlabeled data inefficiently. They also tend to ignore the intermediate knowledge within networks. In this work, we propose a deep active semi-supervised learning framework, DSAL, combining active learning and semi-supervised learning strategies. In DSAL, a new criterion based on deep supervision mechanism is proposed to select informative samples with high uncertainties and low uncertainties for strong labelers and weak labelers respectively. The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate features within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which subsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to select samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo labels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning manner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning methods.},

abstract = {For CT pulmonary angiograms, a scout view obtained in anterior–posterior projection is usually used for planning. For bolus tracking the radiographer manually locates a position in the CT scout view where the pulmonary trunk will be visible in an axial CT pre-scan. We automate the task of localizing the pulmonary trunk in CT scout views by deep learning methods. In 620 eligible CT scout views of 563 patients between March 2003 and February 2020 the region of the pulmonary trunk as well as an optimal slice (“reference standard”) for bolus tracking, in which the pulmonary trunk was clearly visible, was annotated and used to train a U-Net predicting the region of the pulmonary trunk in the CT scout view. The networks' performance was subsequently evaluated on 239 CT scout views from 213 patients and was compared with the annotations of three radiographers. The network was able to localize the region of the pulmonary trunk with high accuracy, yielding an accuracy of 97.5{\%} of localizing a slice in the region of the pulmonary trunk on the validation cohort. On average, the selected position had a distance of 5.3 mm from the reference standard. Compared to radiographers, using a non-inferiority test (one-sided, paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test) the network performed as well as each radiographer (P {\textless} 0.001 in all cases). Automated localization of the region of the pulmonary trunk in CT scout views is possible with high accuracy and is non-inferior to three radiographers.},

To manually label the macroscopic anatomy in magnetic resonance images of 101 healthy participants, we created a new cortical labeling protocol that relies on robust anatomical landmarks and minimal manual edits after initialization with automated labels. The "Desikan-Killiany-Tourville" (DKT) protocol is intended to improve the ease, consistency, and accuracy of labeling human cortical areas. Given how difficult it is to label brains, the Mindboggle-101 dataset is intended to serve as brain atlases for use in labeling other brains, as a normative dataset to establish mor-phometric variation in a healthy population for comparison against clinical populations, and contribute to the development, training, testing, and evaluation of automated registration and labeling algorithms. To this end, we also introduce benchmarks for the evaluation of such algorithms by comparing our manual labels with labels automatically generated by probabilistic and multi-atlas registration-based approaches.

Back-propagation networks provide a way of specifymg such knowledge by imposing constraints both on the architecture of the network and on its weights. In general, such constramts can be considered as particular transformations of the parameter space Building a constramed network for image recogmtton appears to be a feasible task. We descnbe a small handwritten digit recogmtion problem and show that, even though the problem is linearly separable, single layer networks exhibit poor generalizatton performance.

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82{\%} top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) represents a potential paradigm shift in cataract surgery, but it is not without controversy. Advocates of the technology herald FLACS as a revolution that promises superior outcomes and an improved safety profile for patients. Conversely, detractors point to the large financial costs involved and claim that similar results are achievable with conventional small-incision phacoemulsification. This review provides a balanced and comprehensive account of the development of FLACS since its inception. It explains the physiology and mechanics underlying the technology, and critically reviews the outcomes and implications of initial studies. The benefits and limitations of using femtosecond laser accuracy to create corneal incisions, anterior capsulotomy, and lens fragmentation are explored, with reference to the main platforms, which currently offer FLACS. Economic considerations are discussed, in addition to the practicalities associated with the implementation of FLACS in a healthcare setting. The influence on surgical training and skills is considered and possible future applications of the technology introduced. While in its infancy, FLACS sets out the exciting possibility of a new level of precision in cataract surgery. However, further work in the form of large scale, phase 3 randomised controlled trials are required to demonstrate whether its theoretical benefits are significant in practice and worthy of the necessary huge financial investment and system overhaul. Whether it gains widespread acceptance is likely to be influenced by a complex interplay of scientific and socio-economic factors in years to come. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0950-222X/13.},

In this review we investigate the role that humans might play in the development and deployment of deep learning enabled diagnostic applications and focus on techniques that will retain a significant input from a human end user. Human-in-the-Loop computing is an area that we see as increasingly important in future research due to the safety-critical nature of working in the medical domain.

In this paper, we propose a method to learn the parameters of a deep model in one shot. We construct the learner as a second deep network, called a learnet, which predicts the parameters of a pupil network from a single exemplar. In this manner we obtain an efficient feed-forward one-shot learner, trained end-to-end by minimizing a one-shot classification objective in a learning to learn formulation. In order to make the construction feasible, we propose a number of factorizations of the parameters of the pupil network.

We believe that the new connectivity analysis and tractography characteristics proposed can highlight limits of the algorithms and contribute in solving open questions in fiber tracking: from raw data to connectivity analysis. Overall, we show that (i) averaging improves quality of tractography, (ii) sharp angular ODF profiles helps tractography, (iii) seeding and multi-seeding has a large impact on tractography outputs and must be used with care, and (iv) deterministic tractography produces less invalid tracts which leads to better connectivity results than probabilistic tractography. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7{\%}, 99.7{\%}, 99.7{\%} and 99.55{\%} and 97.9{\%}, 97.95{\%}, 97.9{\%}, and 98.8{\%}, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.},

abstract = {Methods to reduce the need for costly data annotations become increasingly important as deep learning gains popularity in medical image analysis and digital pathology. Active learning is an appealing approach that can reduce the amount of annotated data needed to train machine learning models but traditional active learning strategies do not always work well with deep learning. In patch-based machine learning systems, active learning methods typically request annotations for small individual patches which can be tedious and costly for the annotator who needs to rely on visual context for the patches. We propose an active learning framework that selects regions for annotation that are built up of several patches, which should increase annotation throughput. The framework was evaluated with several query strategies on the task of nuclei classification. Convolutional neural networks were trained on small patches, each containing a single nucleus. Traditional query strategies performed worse than random sampling. A K-centre sampling strategy showed a modest gain. Further investigation is needed in order to achieve significant performance gains using deep active learning for this task.},

abstract = {Computer-aided early diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease (AD) and its prodromal form, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Some recent studies have shown promising results in the AD and MCI determination using structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) modalities. Furthermore, fusion of imaging modalities in a supervised machine learning framework has shown promising direction of research. In this paper we first review major trends in automatic classification methods such as feature extraction based methods as well as deep learning approaches in medical image analysis applied to the field of Alzheimer's Disease diagnostics. Then we propose our own algorithm for Alzheimer's Disease diagnostics based on a convolutional neural network and sMRI and DTI modalities fusion on hippocampal ROI using data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). Comparison with a single modality approach shows promising results. We also propose our own method of data augmentation for balancing classes of different size and analyze the impact of the ROI size on the classification results as well.

abstract = {Rationale: Deep learning is a powerful tool that may allow for improved outcome prediction. Objectives: To determine if deep learning, specifically convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis, could detect and stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and predict acute respiratory disease (ARD) events and mortality in smokers. Methods: A CNN was trained using computed tomography scans from 7, 983 COPDGene participants and evaluated using 1,000 nonoverlapping COPDGene participants and 1, 672 ECLIPSE participants. Logistic regression (C statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test) was used to assess COPD diagnosis and ARD prediction. Cox regression (C index and the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agnostino test) was used to assess mortality. Measurements and Main Results: In COPDGene, the C statistic for the detection of COPD was 0.856. A total of 51.1{\%} of participants in COPDGene were accurately staged and 74.95{\%} were within one stage. In ECLIPSE, 29.4{\%} were accurately staged and 74.6{\%} were within one stage. In COPDGene and ECLIPSE, the C statistics for ARD events were 0.64 and 0.55, respectively, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow P values were 0.502 and 0.380, respectively, suggesting no evidence of poor calibration. In COPDGene and ECLIPSE, CNN predicted mortality with fair discrimination (C indices, 0.72 and 0.60, respectively), and without evidence of poor calibration (Greenwood-Nam-D'Agnostino P values, 0.307 and 0.331, respectively). Conclusions: A deep-learning approach that uses only computed tomography imaging data can identify those smokers who have COPD and predict who are most likely to have ARD events and those with the highest mortality. At a population level CNN analysis may be a powerful tool for risk assessment.},

abstract = {Recently deep learning has been witnessing widespread adoption in various medical image applications. However, training complex deep neural nets requires large-scale datasets labeled with ground truth, which are often unavailable in many medical image domains. For instance, to train a deep neural net to detect pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography (CT) images, current practice is to manually label nodule locations and sizes in many CT images to construct a sufficiently large training dataset, which is costly and difficult to scale. On the other hand, electronic medical records (EMR) contain plenty of partial information on the content of each medical image. In this work, we explore how to tap this vast, but currently unexplored data source to improve pulmonary nodule detection. We propose DeepEM, a novel deep 3D ConvNet framework augmented with expectation-maximization (EM), to mine weakly supervised labels in EMRs for pulmonary nodule detection. Experimental results show that DeepEM can lead to 1.5{\%} and 3.9{\%} average improvement in free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) scores on LUNA16 and Tianchi datasets, respectively, demonstrating the utility of incomplete information in EMRs for improving deep learning algorithms (https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepEM-for-Weakly-Supervised-Detection.git ).},

abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes bruteforce search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

The use of conventional Deep Learning techniques to obtain an unbiased model with high generalization accuracy for such datasets is a challenging task. Thus, we formulated a few-shot learning problem and presented a meta-learning-based “MetaMed” approach. The model presented here can adapt to rare disease classes with the availability of few images, and less compute. MetaMed is validated on three publicly accessible medical datasets – Pap smear, BreakHis, and ISIC 2018. We used advanced image augmentation techniques like CutOut, MixUp, and CutMix to overcome the problem of over-fitting. Our approach has shown promising results on all the three datasets with an accuracy of more than 70{\%}. Inclusion of advanced augmentation techniques regularizes the model and increases the generalization capability by  2-5{\%}. Comparative analysis of MetaMed against transfer learning demonstrated that MetaMed classifies images with a higher confidence score and on average outperforms transfer learning for 3, 5, and 10-shot tasks for both 2-way and 3-way classification.},

abstract = {The analysis of microcircuitry (the connectivity at the level of individual neuronal processes and synapses), which is indispensable for our understanding of brain function, is based on serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or one of its modern variants. Due to technical limitations, most previous studies that used serial TEM recorded relatively small stacks of individual neurons. As a result, our knowledge of microcircuitry in any nervous system is very limited. We applied the software package TrakEM2 to reconstruct neuronal microcircuitry from TEM sections of a small brain, the early larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster. TrakEM2 enables us to embed the analysis of the TEM image volumes at the microcircuit level into a light microscopically derived neuro-anatomical framework, by registering confocal stacks containing sparsely labeled neural structures with the TEM image volume. We imaged two sets of serial TEM sections of the Drosophila first instar larval brain neuropile and one ventral nerve cord segment, and here report our first results pertaining to Drosophila brain microcircuitry. Terminal neurites fall into a small number of generic classes termed globular, varicose, axiform, and dendritiform. Globular and varicose neurites have large diameter segments that carry almost exclusively presynaptic sites. Dendritiform neurites are thin, highly branched processes that are almost exclusively postsynaptic. Due to the high branching density of dendritiform fibers and the fact that synapses are polyadic, neurites are highly interconnected even within small neuropile volumes. We describe the network motifs most frequently encountered in the Drosophila neuropile. Our study introduces an approach towards a comprehensive anatomical reconstruction of neuronal microcircuitry and delivers microcircuitry comparisons between vertebrate and insect neuropile. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cardona et al.},

Ultrasound imaging is one of the frequently used diagnosis tool to detect and classify abnormalities of the thyroid gland. The proposed approach comprises of four important stages: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Rayleigh trimmed anisotropic diffusion filter is used for pre-processing. A watershed algorithm is used to segment the nodule region. An artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are employed for the classification task, utilizing feature vectors derived from gray level co-occurrence (GLCM) features. The classification results are evaluated with the use of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. It is derived that SVM classifier provides better result than ANN for discriminating benign and malignant nodules, obtaining accuracy 92.5{\%}, sensitivity 96.66{\%} and specificity 80{\%}.},

abstract = {Recently, dense connections have attracted substantial attention in computer vision because they facilitate gradient flow and implicit deep supervision during training. Particularly, DenseNet that connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion and has shown impressive performances in natural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3-D fully convolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity to multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same path but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion, typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive evaluations over two different and highly competitive multi-modal brain tissue segmentation challenges, iSEG 2017 and MRBrainS 2013, with the former focusing on six month infant data and the latter on adult images. HyperDenseNet yielded significant improvements over many state-of-the-art segmentation networks, ranking at the top on both benchmarks. We further provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of features re-use, which confirms the importance of hyper-dense connections in multi-modal representation learning.

Since the optical density (OD) colorspace allows to compute pixel stain quantities from pixel RGB intensities using the Beer-Lambert's law, we propose a stain deconvolutional layer, hereby named as SD-Layer, affixed at the front of CNN that performs two functions: (1) it transforms the input RGB microscopic images to Optical Density (OD) space and (2) this layer deconvolves OD image with the stain basis learned through backpropagation and provides tissue-specific stain absorption quantities as input to the following CNN layers. With the introduction of only nine additional learnable parameters in the proposed SD-Layer, we obtain a considerably improved performance on two standard CNN architectures: AlexNet and T-CNN. Using the T-CNN architecture prefixed with the proposed SD-Layer, we obtain 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 93.2{\%} in the problem of differentiating malignant immature White Blood Cells (WBCs) from normal immature WBCs for cancer detection.},

abstract = {Diabetic Retinopathy is the most prevalent cause of avoidable vision impairment, mainly affecting the working-age population in the world. Recent research has given a better understanding of the requirement in clinical eye care practice to identify better and cheaper ways of identification, management, diagnosis and treatment of retinal disease. The importance of diabetic retinopathy screening programs and difficulty in achieving reliable early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy at a reasonable cost needs attention to develop computer-aided diagnosis tool. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in retinal image analysis could ease mass screening of populations with diabetes mellitus and help clinicians in utilizing their time more efficiently. The recent technological advances in computing power, communication systems, and machine learning techniques provide opportunities to the biomedical engineers and computer scientists to meet the requirements of clinical practice. Diverse and representative retinal image sets are essential for developing and testing digital screening programs and the automated algorithms at their core. To the best of our knowledge, IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset), is the first database representative of an Indian population. It constitutes typical diabetic retinopathy lesions and normal retinal structures annotated at a pixel level. The dataset provides information on the disease severity of diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema for each image. This makes it perfect for development and evaluation of image analysis algorithms for early detection of diabetic retinopathy.},

abstract = {Both image registration and label fusion in the multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) rely on the intensity similarity between target and atlas images. However, such similarity can be problematic when target and atlas images are acquired using different imaging protocols. High-level structure information can provide reliable similarity measurement for cross-modality images when cooperating with deep neural networks (DNNs). This work presents a new MAS framework for cross-modality images, where both image registration and label fusion are achieved by DNNs. For image registration, we propose a consistent registration network, which can jointly estimate forward and backward dense displacement fields (DDFs). Additionally, an invertible constraint is employed in the network to reduce the correspondence ambiguity of the estimated DDFs. For label fusion, we adapt a few-shot learning network to measure the similarity of atlas and target patches. Moreover, the network can be seamlessly integrated into the patch-based label fusion. The proposed framework is evaluated on the MM-WHS dataset of MICCAI 2017. Results show that the framework is effective in both cross-modality registration and segmentation.},

abstract = {Background: The fronto-striatal network is involved in various motor, cognitive, and emotional processes, such as spatial attention, working memory, decision-making, and emotion regulation. Intermittent theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to modulate functional connectivity of brain networks. Long stimulation intervals, as well as high stimulation intensities are typically applied in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy for mood disorders. The role of stimulation intensity on network function and homeostasis has not been explored systematically yet. Objective: In this pilot study, we aimed to modulate fronto-striatal connectivity by applying iTBS at different intensities to the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We measured individual and group changes by comparing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) both pre-iTBS and post-iTBS. Differential effects of individual sub- vs. supra-resting motor-threshold stimulation intensities were assessed. Methods: Sixteen healthy subjects underwent excitatory iTBS at two intensities [90{\%} and 120{\%} of individual resting motor threshold (rMT)] on separate days. Six-hundred pulses (2 s trains, 8 s pauses, duration of 3 min, 20 s) were applied over the left DLPFC. Directly before and 7 min after stimulation, task-free rsfMRI sessions, lasting 10 min each, were conducted. Individual seed-to-seed functional connectivity changes were calculated for 10 fronto-striatal and amygdala regions of interest with the SPM toolbox DPABI. Results: Sub-threshold-iTBS increased functional connectivity directly between the left DLPFC and the left and right caudate, respectively. Supra-threshold stimulation did not change fronto-striatal functional connectivity but increased functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right caudate. Conclusion: A short iTBS protocol applied at sub-threshold intensities was not only sufficient, but favorable, in order to increase bilateral fronto-striatal functional connectivity, while minimizing side effects. The absence of an increase in functional connectivity after supra-threshold stimulation was possibly caused by network homeostatic effects.},

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.},

So, classifying a number of patients as an AD, MCI or NC based on 3D MRI becomes vague technique using 2D CNN architecture. Hence, to address this issue, we have simplified the idea of classifying patients on basis of 3D MRI but acknowledging the 2D features generated from the CNN framework. We present our idea regarding how to obtain 2D features from MRI and transform it to be applicable to classify using machine learning algorithm. Our experiment shows the result of classifying 3 class subjects patients. We employed scratched trained CNN or pretrained Alexnet CNN as generic feature extractor of 2D image which dimensions were reduced using PCA+TSNE, and finally classifying using simple Machine learning algorithm like KNN, Navies Bayes Classifier. Although the result is not so impressive but it definitely shows that this can be better than scratch trained CNN softmax classification based on probability score. The generated feature can be well manipulated and refined for better accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.},

abstract = {Vertebral labelling and segmentation are two fundamental tasks in an automated spine processing pipeline. Reliable and accurate processing of spine images is expected to benefit clinical decision-support systems for diagnosis, surgery planning, and population-based analysis on spine and bone health. However, designing automated algorithms for spine processing is challenging predominantly due to considerable variations in anatomy and acquisition protocols and due to a severe shortage of publicly available data. Addressing these limitations, the Large Scale Vertebrae Segmentation Challenge (VerSe) was organised in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2019 and 2020, with a call for algorithms towards labelling and segmentation of vertebrae. Two datasets containing a total of 374 multi-detector CT scans from 355 patients were prepared and 4505 vertebrae have individually been annotated at voxel-level by a human-machine hybrid algorithm (https://osf.io/nqjyw/, https://osf.io/t98fz/). A total of 25 algorithms were benchmarked on these datasets. In this work, we present the the results of this evaluation and further investigate the performance-variation at vertebra-level, scan-level, and at different fields-of-view. We also evaluate the generalisability of the approaches to an implicit domain shift in data by evaluating the top performing algorithms of one challenge iteration on data from the other iteration. The principal takeaway from VerSe: the performance of an algorithm in labelling and segmenting a spine scan hinges on its ability to correctly identify vertebrae in cases of rare anatomical variations.

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the variability of tumor unidimensional, bidimensional, and volumetric measurements on same-day repeat computed tomographic (CT) scans in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, with informed patient consent. Thirty-two patients with non-small cell lung cancer, each of whom underwent two CT scans of the chest within 15 minutes by using the same imaging protocol, were included in this study. Three radiologists independently measured the two greatest diameters of each lesion on both scans and, during another session, measured the same tumors on the first scan. In a separate analysis, computer software was applied to assist in the calculation of the two greatest diameters and the volume of each lesion on both scans. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreements between the measurements of the two repeat scans (reproducibility) and between the two repeat readings of the same scan (repeatability). Results: The reproducibility and repeatability of the three radiologists' measurements were high (all CCCs, ≥0.96). The reproducibility of the computer-aided measurements was even higher (all CCCs, 1.00). The 95{\%} limits of agreements for the computer-aided unidimensional, bidimensional, and volumetric measurements on two repeat scans were (-7.3{\%}, 6.2{\%}), (-17.6{\%}, 19.8{\%}), and (-12.1{\%}, 13.4{\%}), respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT scans are well reproducible. Changes in unidimensional lesion size of 8{\%} or greater exceed the measurement variability of the computer method and can be considered significant when estimating the outcome of therapy in a patient. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2009.},

State-of-the-art approaches are mostly based on supervised learning making use of large annotated datasets. Human beings, on the other hand, even non-experts, can detect most abnormal lesions after seeing a handful of healthy brain images. Replicating this capability of using prior information on the appearance of healthy brain structure to detect lesions can help computers achieve human level abnormality detection, specifically reducing the need for numerous labeled examples and bettering generalization of previously unseen lesions. To this end, we study detection of lesion regions in an unsupervised manner by learning data distribution of brain MRI of healthy subjects using auto-encoder based methods. We hypothesize that one of the main limitations of the current models is the lack of consistency in latent representation. We propose a simple yet effective constraint that helps mapping of an image bearing lesion close to its corresponding healthy image in the latent space. We use the Human Connectome Project dataset to learn distribution of healthy-appearing brain MRI and report improved detection, in terms of AUC, of the lesions in the BRATS challenge dataset.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of topologically correct and accurate cortical surfaces from infant MR images is of great importance in neuroimaging mapping of early brain development. However,due to rapid growth and ongoing myelination,infant MR images exhibit extremely low tissue contrast and dynamic appearance patterns,thus leading to much more topological errors (holes and handles) in the cortical surfaces derived from tissue segmentation results,in comparison to adult MR images which typically have good tissue contrast. Existing methods for topological correction either rely on the minimal correction criteria,or ad hoc rules based on image intensity priori,thus often resulting in erroneous correction and large anatomical errors in reconstructed infant cortical surfaces. To address these issues,we propose to correct topological errors by learning information from the anatomical references,i.e.,manually corrected images. Specifically,in our method,we first locate candidate voxels of topologically defected regions by using a topology-preserving level set method. Then,by leveraging rich information of the corresponding patches from reference images,we build regionspecific dictionaries from the anatomical references and infer the correct labels of candidate voxels using sparse representation. Notably,we further integrate these two steps into an iterative framework to enable gradual correction of large topological errors,which are frequently occurred in infant images and cannot be completely corrected using one-shot sparse representation. Extensive experiments on infant cortical surfaces demonstrate that our method not only effectively corrects the topological defects,but also leads to better anatomical consistency,compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory performance in piles of medical image analysis tasks. However the training of deep neural network requires a large amount of samples with high-quality annotations. In medical image segmentation, it is very laborious and expensive to acquire precise pixel-level annotations. Aiming at training deep segmentation models on datasets with probably corrupted annotations, we propose a novel Meta Corrupted Pixels Mining (MCPM) method based on a simple meta mask network. Our method is targeted at automatically estimate a weighting map to evaluate the importance of every pixel in the learning of segmentation network. The meta mask network which regards the loss value map of the predicted segmentation results as input, is capable of identifying out corrupted layers and allocating small weights to them. An alternative algorithm is adopted to train the segmentation network and the meta mask network, simultaneously. Extensive experimental results on LIDC-IDRI and LiTS datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches which are devised for coping with corrupted annotations.},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have resulted in great successes in various applications. Although semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods have been widely investigated, the performance of deep neural networks highly depends on the annotated data. The problem is that the budget for annotation is usually limited due to the annotation time and expensive annotation cost in medical data. Active learning is one of the solutions to this problem where an active learner is designed to indicate which samples need to be annotated to effectively train a target model. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method, confident coreset, which considers both uncertainty and distribution for effectively selecting informative samples. By comparative experiments on two medical image analysis tasks, we show that our method outperforms other active learning methods.},

abstract = {Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible but preventable blindness in working age populations. Color fundus photography (CFP) is the most cost-effective imaging modality to screen for retinal disorders. However, its application to glaucoma has been limited to the computation of a few related biomarkers such as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. Deep learning approaches, although widely applied for medical image analysis, have not been extensively used for glaucoma assessment due to the limited size of the available data sets. Furthermore, the lack of a standardize benchmark strategy makes difficult to compare existing methods in a uniform way. In order to overcome these issues we set up the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge, REFUGE (https://refuge.grand-challenge.org), held in conjunction with MICCAI 2018. The challenge consisted of two primary tasks, namely optic disc/cup segmentation and glaucoma classification. As part of REFUGE, we have publicly released a data set of 1200 fundus images with ground truth segmentations and clinical glaucoma labels, currently the largest existing one. We have also built an evaluation framework to ease and ensure fairness in the comparison of different models, encouraging the development of novel techniques in the field. 12 teams qualified and participated in the online challenge. This paper summarizes their methods and analyzes their corresponding results. In particular, we observed that two of the top-ranked teams outperformed two human experts in the glaucoma classification task. Furthermore, the segmentation results were in general consistent with the ground truth annotations, with complementary outcomes that can be further exploited by ensembling the results.},

abstract = {Multi-contrast MRI protocols increase the level of morphological information available for diagnosis. Yet, the number and quality of contrasts are limited in practice by various factors including scan time and patient motion. Synthesis of missing or corrupted contrasts from other high-quality ones can alleviate this limitation. When a single target contrast is of interest, common approaches for multi-contrast MRI involve either one-to-one or many-to-one synthesis methods depending on their input. One-to-one methods take as input a single source contrast, and they learn a latent representation sensitive to unique features of the source. Meanwhile, many-to-one methods receive multiple distinct sources, and they learn a shared latent representation more sensitive to common features across sources. For enhanced image synthesis, we propose a multi-stream approach that aggregates information across multiple source images via a mixture of multiple one-to-one streams and a joint many-to-one stream. The complementary feature maps generated in the one-to-one streams and the shared feature maps generated in the many-to-one stream are combined with a fusion block. The location of the fusion block is adaptively modified to maximize task-specific performance. Quantitative and radiological assessments on T1,- T2-, PD-weighted, and FLAIR images clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to previous state-of-the-art one-to-one and many-to-one methods.},

Many have shown that expert programmers exhibit remarkable differences from novices in behavioral performance, knowledge structure, and selective attention. However, the underlying differences in the brain are still unclear. We here address this issue by associating the cortical representation of source code with individual programming expertise using a data-driven decoding approach. This approach enabled us to identify seven brain regions, widely distributed in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, that have a tight relationship with programming expertise. In these brain regions, functional categories of source code could be decoded from brain activity and the decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with individual behavioral performances on source-code categorization. Our results suggest that programming expertise is built up on fine-tuned cortical representations specialized for the domain of programming.},

@article{Wang2020,
abstract = {The availability of a large amount of annotated data is critical for many medical image analysis applications, in particular for those relying on deep learning methods which are known to be data-hungry. However, annotated medical data, especially multimodal data, is often scarce and costly to obtain. In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging data (i.e. mp-MRI), which typically consists of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) images, containing clinically significant (CS) prostate cancer (PCa) via semi-supervised learning and adversarial learning. Specifically, our synthesizer generates mp-MRI data in a sequential manner: first utilizing a decoder to generate an ADC map from a 128-d latent vector, followed by translating the ADC to the T2w image via U-Net. The synthesizer is trained in a semi-supervised manner. In the supervised training process, a limited amount of paired ADC-T2w images and the corresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the paired relationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between synthetic and real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an unlimited amount of random latent vectors and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are utilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the marginal image distributions of real images. To improve the robustness for training the synthesizer, we decompose the difficult task of generating full-size images into several simpler tasks which generate sub-images only. A StitchLayer is then employed to seamlessly fuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size image. In addition, to enforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions, we propose to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between CS and nonCS images. Experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize a large variety of mp-MRI images which contain meaningful CS PCa lesions, display a good visual quality and have the correct paired relationship between the two modalities of a pair. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on adversarial learning (Liu and Tuzel, 2016; Costa et al., 2017), our method achieves a significant improvement in terms of both visual quality and several popular quantitative evaluation metrics.},

A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely "ChestX-ray8", which comprises 108,948 frontalview X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with the textmined eight disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified weaklysupervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial quantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural network based "reading chest X-rays" (i.e., recognizing and locating the common disease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task for fully-automated high precision CAD systems.},

abstract = {Angle closure glaucoma (ACG) is a more aggressive disease than open-angle glaucoma, where the abnormal anatomical structures of the anterior chamber angle (ACA) may cause an elevated intraocular pressure and gradually leads to glaucomatous optic neuropathy and eventually to visual impairment and blindness. Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) imaging provides a fast and contactless way to discriminate angle closure from open angle. Although many medical image analysis algorithms have been developed for glaucoma diagnosis, only a few studies have focused on AS-OCT imaging. In particular, there is no public AS-OCT dataset available for evaluating the existing methods in a uniform way, which limits the progress in the development of automated techniques for angle closure detection and assessment. To address this, we organized the Angle closure Glaucoma Evaluation challenge (AGE), held in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. The AGE challenge consisted of two tasks: scleral spur localization and angle closure classification. For this challenge, we released a large data of 4800 annotated AS-OCT images from 199 patients, and also proposed an evaluation framework to benchmark and compare different models. During the AGE challenge, over 200 teams registered online, and more than 1100 results were submitted for online evaluation. Finally, eight teams participated in the onsite challenge. In this paper, we summarize these eight onsite challenge methods and analyze their corresponding results in the two tasks. We further discuss limitations and future directions. In the AGE challenge, the top-performing approach had an average Euclidean Distance of 10 pixel (10µm) in scleral spur localization, while in the task of angle closure classification, all the algorithms achieved the satisfactory performances, especially, 100{\%} accuracy rate for top-two performances. These artificial intelligence techniques were shown to have the potential to enable new developments in AS-OCT image analysis and image-based angle closure glaucoma assessment in particular.},

@article{Aljundi2018,
abstract = {Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems, lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that, given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's rule, which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of learning an embedding for predicting {\textless}subject, predicate, object{\textgreater} triplets. We show state-of-the-art performance and, for the first time, the ability to adapt the importance of the parameters based on unlabeled data towards what the network needs (not) to forget, which may vary depending on test conditions.},

There are a large number of small and inexpensive single-board computers with Linux operating systems available on the market today. Most of these aim for the consumer and enthusiast market, but can also be used in research and commercial applications. This paper builds on several years of experience with using such computers in student projects, as well as the development of cyber-physical and embedded control systems. A summary of the properties that are key for dependability for selected boards is given in tabulated form. These boards have interesting properties for many embedded and cyber-physical systems, e.g. high-performance, small size and low cost. The use of Linux for operating system means a development environment that is familiar to many developers, and the availability of many libraries and applications. While not suitable for applications were formally proven dependability is necessary, we argue that by actively mitigating some of the potential problems identified in this paper such computers can be used in many applications where high dependability is desirable, especially in combination with low-cost. A solution with redundant single-board computers is presented as a strategy for achieving high dependability. Due to the low cost and small size, this is feasible for applications were redundancy traditionally would be prohibitively too large or costly.},

abstract = {We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design. ENAS constructs a large computational graph, where each subgraph represents a neural network architecture, hence forcing all architectures to share their parameters. A controller is trained with policy gradient to search for a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on a validation set. Meanwhile a model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Sharing parameters among child models allows ENAS to deliver strong empirical performances, whilst using much fewer GPU-hours than existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On Penn Treebank, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 56.3, on par with the existing state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On CIFAR-10, ENAS finds a novel architecture that achieves 2.89{\%} test error, which is on par with the 2.65{\%} test error of NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018).},

abstract = {Among brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and aggressive, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 3 x 3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. Our proposal was validated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2013 database (BRATS 2013), obtaining simultaneously the first position for the complete, core, and enhancing regions in Dice Similarity Coefficient metric (0.88, 0.83, 0.77) for the Challenge data set. Also, it obtained the overall first position by the online evaluation platform. We also participated in the on-site BRATS 2015 Challenge using the same model, obtaining the second place, with Dice Similarity Coefficient metric of 0.78, 0.65, and 0.75 for the complete, core, and enhancing regions, respectively.},

abstract = {For better perception and analysis of images, good quality and high resolution (HR) are always preferred over degraded and low resolution (LR) images. Getting HR images can be cost and time prohibitive. Super resolution (SR) techniques can be an affordable alternative for small zoom factors. In medical imaging, specifically in the case of histological images, estimating an HR image from an LR one requires preservation of complex textures and edges defining various biological features (nuclei, cytoplasm etc.). This challenge is further aggravated by the scale variance of histological images that are taken of a flat biopsy slide instead of a 3D world. We propose an algorithm for SR of histological images that learns a mapping from zero-phase component analysis (ZCA)-whitened LR patches to ZCA-whitened HR patches at the desired scale. ZCA-whitening exploits the redundancy in data and enhances the texture and edges energies to better learn the desired LR to HR mapping, which we learn using a neural network. The qualitative and quantitative validation shows that improvements in HR estimation by proposed algorithm are statistically significant over benchmark learning-based SR algorithms.},

abstract = {Over the last few years deep learning methods have emerged as one of the most prominent approaches for video analysis. However, so far their most successful applications have been in the area of video classification and detection, i.e., problems involving the prediction of a single class label or a handful of output variables per video. Furthermore, while deep networks are commonly recognized as the best models to use in these domains, there is a widespread perception that in order to yield successful results they often require time-consuming architecture search, manual tweaking of parameters and computationally intensive preprocessing or post-processing methods. In this paper we challenge these views by presenting a deep 3D convolutional architecture trained end to end to perform voxel-level prediction, i.e., to output a variable at every voxel of the video. Most importantly, we show that the same exact architecture can be used to achieve competitive results on three widely different voxel-prediction tasks: video semantic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and video coloring. The three networks learned on these problems are trained from raw video without any form of preprocessing and their outputs do not require post-processing to achieve outstanding performance. Thus, they offer an efficient alternative to traditional and much more computationally expensive methods in these video domains.},

abstract = {Nuclear segmentation and classification within Haematoxylin {\&} Eosin stained histology images is a fundamental prerequisite in the digital pathology work-flow. The development of automated methods for nuclear segmentation and classification enables the quantitative analysis of tens of thousands of nuclei within a whole-slide pathology image, opening up possibilities of further analysis of large-scale nuclear morphometry. However, automated nuclear segmentation and classification is faced with a major challenge in that there are several different types of nuclei, some of them exhibiting large intra-class variability such as the nuclei of tumour cells. Additionally, some of the nuclei are often clustered together. To address these challenges, we present a novel convolutional neural network for simultaneous nuclear segmentation and classification that leverages the instance-rich information encoded within the vertical and horizontal distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass. These distances are then utilised to separate clustered nuclei, resulting in an accurate segmentation, particularly in areas with overlapping instances. Then, for each segmented instance the network predicts the type of nucleus via a devoted up-sampling branch. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods on multiple independent multi-tissue histology image datasets. As part of this work, we introduce a new dataset of Haematoxylin {\&} Eosin stained colorectal adenocarcinoma image tiles, containing 24,319 exhaustively annotated nuclei with associated class labels.},

abstract = {Breast cancer diagnosis based on medical imaging necessitates both fine-grained lesion segmentation and disease grading. Although deep learning (DL) offers an emerging and powerful paradigm of feature learning for these two tasks, it is hampered from popularizing in practical application due to the lack of interpretability, generalization ability, and large labeled training sets. In this article, we propose a hierarchical fused model based on DL and fuzzy learning to overcome the drawbacks for pixelwise segmentation and disease grading of mammography breast images. The proposed system consists of a segmentation model (ResU-segNet) and a hierarchical fuzzy classifier (HFC) that is a fusion of interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy c-means and fuzzy neural network. The ResU-segNet segments the masks of mass regions from the images through convolutional neural networks, while the HFC encodes the features from mass images and masks to obtain the disease grading through fuzzy representation and rule-based learning. Through the integration of feature extraction aided by domain knowledge and fuzzy learning, the system achieves favorable performance in a few-shot learning manner, and the deterioration of cross-dataset generalization ability is alleviated. In addition, the interpretability is further enhanced. The effectiveness of the proposed system is analyzed on the publicly available mammogram database of INbreast and a private database through cross-validation. Thorough comparative experiments are also conducted and demonstrated.},

abstract = {Machine learning has been highly successful in data-intensive applications but is often hampered when the data set is small. Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.1},

abstract = {Kidney volume is an essential biomarker for a number of kidney disease diagnoses, for example, chronic kidney disease. Existing total kidney volume estimation methods often rely on an intermediate kidney segmentation step. On the other hand, automatic kidney localization in volumetric medical images is a critical step that often precedes subsequent data processing and analysis. Most current approaches perform kidney localization via an intermediate classification or regression step. This paper proposes an integrated deep learning approach for (i) kidney localization in computed tomography scans and (ii) segmentation-free renal volume estimation. Our localization method uses a selection-convolutional neural network that approximates the kidney inferior-superior span along the axial direction. Cross-sectional (2D) slices from the estimated span are subsequently used in a combined sagittal-axial Mask-RCNN that detects the organ bounding boxes on the axial and sagittal slices, the combination of which produces a final 3D organ bounding box. Furthermore, we use a fully convolutional network to estimate the kidney volume that skips the segmentation procedure.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

However, pathologists can only visually detect signet ring cells under the microscope. This procedure is not only laborious but also prone to omission. An automatic and accurate signet ring cell detection solution is thus important but has not been investigated before. In this paper, we take the first step to present a semi-supervised learning framework for the signet ring cell detection problem. Self-training is proposed to deal with the challenge of incomplete annotations, and cooperative-training is adapted to explore the unlabeled regions. Combining the two techniques, our semi-supervised learning framework can make better use of both labeled and unlabeled data. Experiments on large real clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. Our framework achieves accurate signet ring cell detection and can be readily applied in the clinical trails.

However, because of the internal complexity and nonlinear structure of deep neural networks, the underlying decision making processes for why these models are achieving such performance are challenging and sometimes mystifying to interpret. As deep learning spreads across domains, it is of paramount importance that we equip users of deep learning with tools for understanding when a model works correctly, when it fails, and ultimately how to improve its performance. Standardized toolkits for building neural networks have helped democratize deep learning; visual analytics systems have now been developed to support model explanation, interpretation, debugging, and improvement. We present a survey of the role of visual analytics in deep learning research, which highlights its short yet impactful history and thoroughly summarizes the state-of-the-art using a human-centered interrogative framework, focusing on the Five W's and How (Why, Who, What, How, When, and Where).

abstract = {Objective: To develop an approach for radiology-pathology fusion of ex vivo histology of surgically excised pulmonary nodules with pre-operative CT, to radiologically map spatial extent of the invasive adenocarcinomatous component of the nodule. Methods: Six subjects (age: 75 ± 11 years) with pre-operative CT and surgically excised ground-glass nodules (size: 22.5 ± 5.1 mm) with a significant invasive adenocarcinomatous component ({\textgreater}5 mm) were included. The pathologist outlined disease extent on digitized histology specimens; two radiologists and a pulmonary critical care physician delineated the entire nodule on CT (in-plane resolution: {\textless}0.8 mm, inter-slice distance: 1–5 mm). We introduced a novel reconstruction approach to localize histology slices in 3D relative to each other while using CT scan as spatial constraint. This enabled the spatial mapping of the extent of tumour invasion from histology onto CT. Results: Good overlap of the 3D reconstructed histology and the nodule outlined on CT was observed (65.9 ± 5.2{\%}). Reduction in 3D misalignment of corresponding anatomical landmarks on histology and CT was observed (1.97 ± 0.42 mm). Moreover, the CT attenuation (HU) distributions were different when comparing invasive and in situ regions. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study suggests that our fusion method can enable the spatial mapping of the invasive adenocarcinomatous component from 2D histology slices onto in vivo CT. Key Points: • 3D reconstructions are generated from 2D histology specimens of ground glass nodules. • The reconstruction methodology used pre-operative in vivo CT as 3D spatial constraint. • The methodology maps adenocarcinoma extent from digitized histology onto in vivo CT. • The methodology potentially facilitates the discovery of CT signature of invasive adenocarcinoma.},

abstract = {Learning-based methods for visual segmentation have made progress on particular types of segmentation tasks, but are limited by the necessary supervision, the narrow definitions of fixed tasks, and the lack of control during inference for correcting errors. To remedy the rigidity and annotation burden of standard approaches, we address the problem of few-shot segmentation: Given few image and few pixel supervision, segment any images accordingly. We propose guided networks, which extract a latent task representation from any amount of supervision, and optimize our architecture end-to-end for fast, accurate few-shot segmentation. Our method can switch tasks without further optimization and quickly update when given more guidance. We report the first results for segmentation from one pixel per concept and show real-time interactive video segmentation. Our unified approach propagates pixel annotations across space for interactive segmentation, across time for video segmentation, and across scenes for semantic segmentation. Our guided segmentor is state-of-the-art in accuracy for the amount of annotation and time. See http://github.com/shelhamer/revolver for code, models, and more details.},

abstract = {Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

Investigators have been encouraged to publish their clinical and imaging data as part of fulfilling their grant obligations. Realizing it was not sufficient to merely ask investigators to publish their collection of imaging and clinical data, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created the open source National Biomedical Image Archive software package as a mechanism for centralized hosting of cancer related imaging. NCI has contracted with Washington University in Saint Louis to create The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) - an open-source, open-access information resource to support research, development, and educational initiatives utilizing advanced medical imaging of cancer. In its first year of operation, TCIA accumulated 23 collections (3.3 million images). Operating and maintaining a high-availability image archive is a complex challenge involving varied archive-specific resources and driven by the needs of both image submitters and image consumers. Quality archives of any type (traditional library, PubMed, refereed journals) require management and customer service.

Automated classification is however very challenging due to the high degree of visual similarity between the two types of images. In this paper, we propose to describe the bone textures by extracting dense sets of local descriptors and encoding them with the improved Fisher vector (IFV). Compared to the standard bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, Fisher encoding is more discriminative by representing the distribution of local descriptors in addition to the occurrence frequencies. Our method is evaluated on the ISBI 2014 challenge dataset of bone texture characterization, and we demonstrate excellent classification performance compared to the challenge entries and large improvement over the BoW model.},

Radiomics is foreseen as an essential prognostic tool for cancer risk assessment and the quantification of intratumoural heterogeneity. In this work, 1615 radiomic features (quantifying tumour image intensity, shape, texture) extracted from pre-treatment FDG-PET and CT images of 300 patients from four different cohorts were analyzed for the risk assessment of locoregional recurrences (LR) and distant metastases (DM) in head-and-neck cancer. Prediction models combining radiomic and clinical variables were constructed via random forests and imbalance-adjustment strategies using two of the four cohorts. Independent validation of the prediction and prognostic performance of the models was carried out on the other two cohorts (LR: AUC = 0.69 and CI = 0.67; DM: AUC = 0.86 and CI = 0.88). Furthermore, the results obtained via Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the potential of radiomics for assessing the risk of specific tumour outcomes using multiple stratification groups. This could have important clinical impact, notably by allowing for a better personalization of chemo-radiation treatments for head-and-neck cancer patients from different risk groups.},

Automatic tools can help automate parts of this manual process. A cloud-based evaluation framework is presented in this paper including results of benchmarking current state-of-the-art medical imaging algorithms for anatomical structure segmentation and landmark detection: the VISCERAL Anatomy benchmarks. The algorithms are implemented in virtual machines in the cloud where participants can only access the training data and can be run privately by the benchmark administrators to objectively compare their performance in an unseen common test set. Overall, 120 computed tomography and magnetic resonance patient volumes were manually annotated to create a standard Gold Corpus containing a total of 1295 structures and 1760 landmarks. Ten participants contributed with automatic algorithms for the organ segmentation task, and three for the landmark localization task. Different algorithms obtained the best scores in the four available imaging modalities and for subsets of anatomical structures. The annotation framework, resulting data set, evaluation setup, results and performance analysis from the three VISCERAL Anatomy benchmarks are presented in this article. Both the VISCERAL data set and Silver Corpus generated with the fusion of the participant algorithms on a larger set of non-manually-annotated medical images are available to the research community.},

In this work, we adapt a domain generalization method based on a model-agnostic meta-learning framework[1] to biomedical imaging. The method learns a domain-agnostic feature representation to improve generalization of models to the unseen test distribution. The method can be used for any imaging task, as it does not depend on the underlying model architecture. We validate the approach through a computed tomography (CT) vertebrae segmentation task across healthy and pathological cases on three datasets. Next, we employ few-shot learning, i.e. training the generalized model using very few examples from the unseen domain, to quickly adapt the model to new unseen data distribution. Our results suggest that the method could help generalize models across different medical centers, image acquisition protocols, anatomies, different regions in a given scan, healthy and diseased populations across varied imaging modalities.},

abstract = {Medical images usually exhibit large intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity in the feature space, which could affect classification accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose a new Large Margin Local Estimate (LMLE) classification model with sub-categorization based sparse representation. We first sub-categorize the reference sets of different classes into multiple clusters, to reduce feature variation within each subcategory compared to the entire reference set. Local estimates are generated for the test image using sparse representation with reference subcategories as the dictionaries. The similarity between the test image and each class is then computed by fusing the distances with the local estimates in a learning-based large margin aggregation construct to alleviate the problem of inter-class ambiguity. The derived similarities are finally used to determine the class label. We demonstrate that our LMLE model is generally applicable to different imaging modalities, and applied it to three tasks: interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images, phenotype binary classification and continuous regression on brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Our experimental results show statistically significant performance improvements over existing popular classifiers.},

In this study, a progressive learning vector quantization neural network (PLVQNN) combined with a preprocessing procedure is proposed for automatic thyroid segmentation and volume estimation using computerized tomography (CT) images. The preprocessing procedure is used to extract the region of interest (ROI) of thyroid glands and exclude non-thyroid glands based on thyroid anatomy. The PLVQNN contains several learning vector quantization neural networks (LVQNNs), each responsible for segmenting one slice of a thyroid CT image. The training of the PLVQNN is conducted starting from the LVQNN of most reliable (middle) slices, where the thyroid has the largest region. The training then propagates upwards and downwards to adjacent LVQNNs using the results of the middle slice as the initialization values and constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively segment thyroid glands and estimate thyroid volume. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose: This report presents the methods and results of the Thoracic Auto-Segmentation Challenge organized at the 2017 Annual Meeting of American Association of Physicists in Medicine. The purpose of the challenge was to provide a benchmark dataset and platform for evaluating performance of autosegmentation methods of organs at risk (OARs) in thoracic CT images. Methods : Sixty thoracic CT scans provided by three different institutions were separated into 36 training, 12 offline testing, and 12 online testing scans. Eleven participants completed the offline challenge, and seven completed the online challenge. The OARs were left and right lungs, heart, esophagus, and spinal cord. Clinical contours used for treatment planning were quality checked and edited to adhere to the RTOG 1106 contouring guidelines. Algorithms were evaluated using the Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and mean surface distance. A consolidated score was computed by normalizing the metrics against interrater variability and averaging over all patients and structures. Results : The interrater study revealed highest variability in Dice for the esophagus and spinal cord, and in surface distances for lungs and heart. Five out of seven algorithms that participated in the online challenge employed deep-learning methods. Although the top three participants using deep learning produced the best segmentation for all structures, there was no significant difference in the performance among them. The fourth place participant used a multi-atlas-based approach. The highest Dice scores were produced for lungs, with averages ranging from 0.95 to 0.98, while the lowest Dice scores were produced for esophagus, with a range of 0.55–0.72. Conclusion : The results of the challenge showed that the lungs and heart can be segmented fairly accurately by various algorithms, while deep-learning methods performed better on the esophagus. Our dataset together with the manual contours for all training cases continues to be available publicly as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

abstract = {The perceptual representation of individual faces is often explained with reference to a norm-based face space. In such spaces, individuals are encoded as vectors where identity is primarily conveyed by direction and distinctiveness by eccentricity. Here we measured human fMRI responses and psychophysical similarity judgments of individual face exemplars, which were generated as realistic 3D animations using a computer-graphics model. We developed and evaluated multiple neurobiologically plausible computational models, each of which predicts a representational distance matrix and a regional-mean activation profile for 24 face stimuli. In the fusiform face area, a face-space coding model with sigmoidal ramp tuning provided a better account of the data than one based on exemplar tuning. However, an image-processing model with weighted banks of Gabor filters performed similarly. Accounting for the data required the inclusion of a measurement-level population averaging mechanism that approximates how fMRI voxels locally average distinct neuronal tunings. Our study demonstrates the importance of comparing multiple models and of modeling the measurement process in computational neuroimaging.},

In response, recent work in meta-learning proposes training a meta-learner on a distribution of similar tasks, in the hopes of generalization to novel but related tasks by learning a high-level strategy that captures the essence of the problem it is asked to solve. However, many recent meta-learning approaches are extensively hand-designed, either using architectures specialized to a particular application, or hard-coding algorithmic components that constrain how the meta-learner solves the task. We propose a class of simple and generic meta-learner architectures that use a novel combination of temporal convolutions and soft attention; the former to aggregate information from past experience and the latter to pinpoint specific pieces of information. In the most extensive set of meta-learning experiments to date, we evaluate the resulting Simple Neural AttentIve Learner (or SNAIL) on several heavily-benchmarked tasks. On all tasks, in both supervised and reinforcement learning, SNAIL attains state-of-the-art performance by significant margins.},

Contrary to conventional approaches to AI where a given task is solved from scratch using a fixed learning algorithm, meta-learning aims to improve the learning algorithm itself, given the experience of multiple learning episodes. This paradigm provides an opportunity to tackle many of the conventional challenges of deep learning, including data and computation bottlenecks, as well as the fundamental issue of generalization. In this survey we describe the contemporary meta-learning landscape. We first discuss definitions of meta-learning and position it with respect to related fields, such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and hyperparameter optimization. We then propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of meta-learning methods today. We survey promising applications and successes of meta-learning including few-shot learning, reinforcement learning and architecture search.

One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies is the requirement of feeding a vast amount of annotated and labelled images by a human to train the network model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on previously known concepts and auxiliary information. It is an ever-growing research area since it has human-like characteristics in learning new concepts, which makes it applicable in many real-world scenarios, from autonomous vehicles to surveillance systems to medical imaging and COVID-19 CT scan-based diagnosis. In this paper, we present the definition of the problem, we review over fundamentals, and the challenging steps of Zero-shot learning, including recent categories of solutions, motivations behind each approach, and their advantages over other categories. Inspired from different settings and extensions, we have a broaden solution called one/few-shot learning. We then review thorough datasets, the variety of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent applications and possible future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling computer vision learning tasks more similar to the way humans learn.},

Deformable image registration can be time-consuming and often needs extensive parameterization to perform well on a specific application. We present a step towards a registration framework based on a three-dimensional convolutional neural network. The network directly learns transformations between pairs of three-dimensional images. The outputs of the network are three maps for the x, y, and z components of a thin plate spline transformation grid. The network is trained on synthetic random transformations, which are applied to a small set of representative images for the desired application. Training therefore does not require manually annotated ground truth deformation information. The methodology is demonstrated on public data sets of inspiration-expiration lung CT image pairs, which come with annotated corresponding landmarks for evaluation of the registration accuracy. Advantages of this methodology are its fast registration times and its minimal parameterization.},

The Lumigraph is a subset of the complete plenoptic function that describes the flow of light at all positions in all directions. With the Lumigraph, new images of the object can be generated very quickly, independent of the geometric or illumination complexity of the scene or object.

The sheer size of these networks can represent a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3× improve- ment over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10× speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4× speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware.},

abstract = {It is a challenging problem to achieve generalized nuclear segmentation in digital histopathology images. Existing techniques, using either handcrafted features in learning-based models or traditional image analysis-based approaches, do not effectively tackle the challenging cases, such as crowded nuclei, chromatin-sparse, and heavy background clutter. In contrast, deep networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in modeling various nuclear appearances. However, their success is limited due to the size of the considered networks. We solve these problems by reformulating nuclear segmentation in terms of a cascade 2-class classification problem and propose a multi-layer boosting sparse convolutional (ML-BSC)model. In the proposed ML-BSC model, discriminative probabilistic binary decision trees (PBDTs)are designed as weak learners in each layer to cope with challenging cases. A sparsity-constrained cascade structure enables the ML-BSC model to improve representation learning. Comparing to the existing techniques, our method can accurately separate individual nuclei in complex histopathology images, and it is more robust against chromatin-sparse and heavy background clutter. An evaluation carried out using three disparate datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art supervised approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved impressive performances in image processing tasks such as image classification and object recognition. However, CNNs typically have a large number of parameters, leading to their requirement of a large number of training samples to extract spatial features. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight ScatterNet with the learnable weight matrix and sparse transformation such as scale transformation and translation to learn sparse filters. This filter based on ScatterNet uses He initialization algorithm and learns from input images which are viewed as two-directional sequential data in the initial stage of model training. A Strip-Recurrent module sweeps both horizontally and vertically across the image to compress feature matrices. Then, ScatterNet decomposes the above feature matrices as a learned mixture of different harmonic functions to integrate the spectral analysis into CNNs. Finally, we combine the sequential and spectral features to build our hybrid architectures to complete image classification and segmentation. These architectures can obtain good classification accuracy on both small and large training datasets. Our proposed method is evaluated at both layer and network levels on five widely-used benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Small NORB and Tiny ImageNet. We also study other small sample problems such as medical image segmentation and image classification based on few-shot learning. Experiments show that our proposed layer and hybrid model achieves better accuracy for small sample training.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, irreversible brain disorder, no effective cure for it till now. However, available medicines can delay its progress. Therefore, the early detection of AD plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling its progression. The main objective is to design an end-to-end framework for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and medical image classification for various AD stages. A deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), is used in this work. Four stages of the AD spectrum are multi-classified. Furthermore, separate binary medical image classifications are implemented between each two-pair class of AD stages. Two methods are used to classify the medical images and detect AD. The first method uses simple CNN architectures that deal with 2D and 3D structural brain scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset based on 2D and 3D convolution. The second method applies the transfer learning principle to take advantage of the pre-trained models for medical image classifications, such as the VGG19 model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for people to go to hospitals periodically to avoid gatherings and infections. As a result, Alzheimer's checking web application is proposed using the final qualified proposed architectures. It helps doctors and patients to check AD remotely. It also determines the AD stage of the patient based on the AD spectrum and advises the patient according to its AD stage. Nine performance metrics are used in the evaluation and the comparison between the two methods. The experimental results prove that the CNN architectures for the first method have the following characteristics: suitable simple structures that reduce computational complexity, memory requirements, overfitting, and provide manageable time. Besides, they achieve very promising accuracies, 93.61{\%} and 95.17{\%} for 2D and 3D multi-class AD stage classifications. The VGG19 pre-trained model is fine-tuned and achieved an accuracy of 97{\%} for multi-class AD stage classifications.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia that still has no effective treatment. Accurate classification of AD can help in its diagnosis and selection of the most effective treatment options. In the last decade, several studies have proven the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a U-net style model for AD diagnosis using 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Combining with deep supervision has been proved to be effective in improving the performance of the model. Our method has been tested on a subset of ADNI dataset and AIBL dataset and achieves a superior average accuracy of 95.71 ± 1.36 {\%} for AD versus NC (normal control), 90.14 ± 3.66 {\%} for EMCI (early mild cognitive impairment) versus LMCI (late mild cognitive impairment), 90.05 ± 2.63 {\%} for AD versus LMCI, and 87.98 ± 4.54 {\%} for NC versus EMCI, respectively. Besides these binary-classification tasks, we also test this model for multi-class classification task (AD vs. NC vs. EMCI vs. LMCI) and it achieves an accuracy of 86.47 ± 9.60 {\%}. Furthermore, 3D-Grad-CAM method is used to visualize the focused areas of the proposed model. We find that the proposed model pays more attention to the characteristics of the ventricles, hippocampus, and some regions of cortex, which have been proven to be affected by AD.},

abstract = {As the world moves towards being increasingly dependent on computers and automation, building secure applications, systems and networks are some of the main challenges faced in the current decade. The number of threats that individuals and businesses face is rising exponentially due to the increasing complexity of networks and services of modern networks. To alleviate the impact of these threats, researchers have proposed numerous solutions for anomaly detection; however, current tools often fail to adapt to ever-changing architectures, associated threats and zero-day attacks. This manuscript aims to pinpoint research gaps and shortcomings of current datasets, their impact on building Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and the growing number of sophisticated threats. To this end, this manuscript provides researchers with two key pieces of information; a survey of prominent datasets, analyzing their use and impact on the development of the past decade's Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and a taxonomy of network threats and associated tools to carry out these attacks. The manuscript highlights that current IDS research covers only 33.3{\%} of our threat taxonomy. Current datasets demonstrate a clear lack of real-network threats, attack representation and include a large number of deprecated threats, which together limit the detection accuracy of current machine learning IDS approaches. The unique combination of the taxonomy and the analysis of the datasets provided in this manuscript aims to improve the creation of datasets and the collection of real-world data. As a result, this will improve the efficiency of the next generation IDS and reflect network threats more accurately within new datasets.},

abstract = {Cephalometry is an essential clinical and research tool in orthodontics. It has been used for decades to obtain absolute and relative measures of the craniofacial skeleton. Since manual identification of predefined anatomical landmarks is a very tedious approach, there is a strong need for automated methods. This paper explores the use of Zernike moment-based global features for initial landmark estimation and computing small expectation window for each landmark. Using this expectation window and local template matching based on ring and central projection method, a closer approximation of landmark position is obtained. A smaller search window based on this approximation is used to find the exact location of landmark positions based on template matching using a combination of sum of squared distance and normalized cross-correlation. The system was tested on 18 commonly used landmarks using a dataset of 85 randomly selected cephalograms. A total of 89.5 {\%} of the localization of 18 selected landmarks are within a window of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$le $\backslash$!$\backslash$!$\backslash$pm 2$\backslash$text{\{} mm{\}}{\$}{\$}. The average mean error for the 18 landmarks is 1.84 mm and average SD of mean error is 1.24.},

abstract = {Cell nuclei detection is a challenging research topic because of limitations in cellular image quality and diversity of nuclear morphology, i.e., varying nuclei shapes, sizes, and overlaps between multiple cell nuclei. This has been a topic of enduring interest with promising recent success shown by deep learning methods. These methods train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a training set of input images and known, labeled nuclei locations. Many such methods are supplemented by spatial or morphological processing. Using a set of canonical cell nuclei shapes, prepared with the help of a domain expert, we develop a new approach that we call shape priors (SPs) with CNNs (SPs-CNN). We further extend the network to introduce an SP layer and then allowing it to become trainable (i.e., optimizable). We call this network as tunable SP-CNN (TSP-CNN). In summary, we present new network structures that can incorporate "expected behavior" of nucleus shapes via two components: learnable layers that perform the nucleus detection and a fixed processing part that guides the learning with prior information. Analytically, we formulate two new regularization terms that are targeted at: 1) learning the shapes and 2) reducing false positives while simultaneously encouraging detection inside the cell nucleus boundary. Experimental results on two challenging datasets reveal that the proposed SP-CNN and TSP-CNN can outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives.},

DRL algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of RL, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep RL, including the deep Q-network (DQN), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage actor critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via RL. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for detecting a tumor from a brain MR image automatically using discriminative clustering based brain MRI segmentation. The main objective of this paper is to perform an automatic brain tumor detection which uses superpixel zoning for its initial segmentation, which reduces computational overhead and uses discriminative clustering which accounts for tissue heterogeneity in brain MR images. In the past few years, automated brain tumor detection has become an effective topic of research in medical diagnostics and clinical expedition. Superpixel zoning of brain tissues from a brain MR image is used in this paper and superpixel zones are constructed by analyzing the intensity values of the neighborhood pixels. In clustering of these brain tissues, it still faces challenges such as tissue heterogeneity and redundancy of MRI features. To encounter these challenges, we have used a discriminative clustering method to segregate the vital regions of brain such as cerebro spinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). This method uses a haar wavelet transform, which generates candidate area matrix vectors. These vectors are transformed into feature vectors which in turn used for feature selection in the dimensionality reduction. This method also uses a classification algorithm namely, AdaBoost with random forests (ADBRF) algorithm which builds a classifier that categorize the input image into tumor affected or unaffected. Experimental results of the proposed algorithm are compared to the existing methods on brain MRI segmentation and brain tumor detection shows our method outclasses the other advanced methods.},

abstract = {Automatic and accurate 3D cardiac image segmentation plays a crucial role in cardiac disease diagnosis and treatment. Even though CNN based techniques have achieved great success in medical image segmentation, the expensive annotation, large memory consumption, and insufficient generalization ability still pose challenges to their application in clinical practice, especially in the case of 3D segmentation from high-resolution and large-dimension volumetric imaging. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning framework by combining ideas of semi-supervised learning and self-training for whole heart segmentation and achieve promising accuracy with a Dice score of 0.890 and a Hausdorff distance of 18.539 mm with only four labeled data for training. When more labeled data provided, the model can generalize better across institutions. The key to success lies in the selection and evolution of high-quality pseudo labels in cascaded learning. A shape-constrained network is built to assess the quality of pseudo labels, and the self-training stages with alternative global-local perspectives are employed to improve the pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on the CTA dataset of the MM-WHS 2017 Challenge and a larger multi-center dataset. In the experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly and has great generalization ability on the unseen data. We also demonstrate, by a study of two 4D (3D+T) CTA data, the potential of our method to be applied in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Recently, automatic diagnostic approaches have been widely used to classify ocular diseases. Most of these approaches are based on a single imaging modality (e.g., fundus photography or optical coherence tomography (OCT)), which usually only reflect the oculopathy to a certain extent, and neglect the modality-specific information among different imaging modalities. This paper proposes a novel modality-specific attention network (MSAN) for multi-modal retinal image classification, which can effectively utilize the modality-specific diagnostic features from fundus and OCT images. The MSAN comprises two attention modules to extract the modality-specific features from fundus and OCT images, respectively. Specifically, for the fundus image, ophthalmologists need to observe local and global pathologies at multiple scales (e.g., from microaneurysms at the micrometer level, optic disc at millimeter level to blood vessels through the whole eye). Therefore, we propose a multi-scale attention module to extract both the local and global features from fundus images. Moreover, large background regions exist in the OCT image, which is meaningless for diagnosis. Thus, a region-guided attention module is proposed to encode the retinal layer-related features and ignore the background in OCT images. Finally, we fuse the modality-specific features to form a multi-modal feature and train the multi-modal retinal image classification network. The fusion of modality-specific features allows the model to combine the advantages of fundus and OCT modality for a more accurate diagnosis. Experimental results on a clinically acquired multi-modal retinal image (fundus and OCT) dataset demonstrate that our MSAN outperforms other well-known single-modal and multi-modal retinal image classification methods.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Medical imaging datasets are limited in size due to privacy issues and the high cost of obtaining annotations. Augmentation is a widely used practice in deep learning to enrich the data in data-limited scenarios and to avoid overfitting. However, standard augmentation methods that produce new examples of data by varying lighting, field of view, and spatial rigid transformations do not capture the biological variance of medical imaging data and could result in unrealistic images. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an avenue to understand the underlying structure of image data which can then be utilized to generate new realistic samples. In this work, we investigate the use of GANs for producing chest X-ray images to augment a dataset. This dataset is then used to train a convolutional neural network to classify images for cardiovascular abnormalities. We compare our augmentation strategy with traditional data augmentation and show higher accuracy for normal vs abnormal classification in chest X-rays.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word "reinforcement." The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

Precise detection of specific artifacts like pixel saturations, motion blur, specular reections, bubbles and debris is essential for high-quality frame restoration and is crucial for realizing reliable computer-assisted tools for improved patient care. At present most videos in endoscopy are currently not analyzed due to the abundant presence of multiclass artifacts in video frames. Through the endoscopic artifact detection (EAD 2019) challenge, we address this key bottleneck problem by solving the accurate identification and localization of endoscopic frame artifacts to enable further key quantitative analysis of unusable video frames such as mosaicking and 3D reconstruction which is crucial for delivering improved patient care.

One of our main interests is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation. We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with detailed annotations.

abstract = {Background: For breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), pathologic complete response (pCR; no invasive or in situ) cannot be assessed non-invasively so all patients undergo surgery. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a radiomics classifier that classifies breast cancer pCR post-NAC on MRI prior to surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included women treated with NAC for breast cancer from 2014 to 2016 with (1) pre- and post-NAC breast MRI and (2) post-NAC surgical pathology report assessing response. Automated radiomics analysis of pre- and post-NAC breast MRI involved image segmentation, radiomics feature extraction, feature pre-filtering, and classifier building through recursive feature elimination random forest (RFE-RF) machine learning. The RFE-RF classifier was trained with nested five-fold cross-validation using (a) radiomics only (model 1) and (b) radiomics and molecular subtype (model 2). Class imbalance was addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Results: Two hundred seventy-three women with 278 invasive breast cancers were included; the training set consisted of 222 cancers (61 pCR, 161 no-pCR; mean age 51.8 years, SD 11.8), and the independent test set consisted of 56 cancers (13 pCR, 43 no-pCR; mean age 51.3 years, SD 11.8). There was no significant difference in pCR or molecular subtype between the training and test sets. Model 1 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.72 (95{\%} CI 0.64, 0.79) and a similarly accurate (P = 0.1) AUROC of 0.83 (95{\%} CI 0.71, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Model 2 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.80 (95{\%} CI 0.72, 0.87) and a similar (P = 0.9) AUROC of 0.78 (95{\%} CI 0.62, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Conclusions: This study validated a radiomics classifier combining radiomics with molecular subtypes that accurately classifies pCR on MRI post-NAC.},

abstract = {Computer vision is an important cornerstone for the foundation of many modern technologies. The development of modern computer-aided-surgery, especially in the context of surgical navigation for minimally invasive surgery, is one example. Surgical navigation provides the necessary spatial information in computer-aided-surgery. Amongst the various forms of perception, vision-based sensing has been proposed as a promising candidate for tracking and localisation application largely due to its ability to provide timely intra-operative feedback and contactless sensing. The motivation for vision-based sensing in surgical navigation stems from many factors, including the challenges faced by other forms of navigation systems. A common surgical navigation system performs tracking of surgical tools with external tracking systems, which may suffer from both technical and usability issues. Vision-based tracking offers a relatively streamlined framework compared to those approaches implemented with external tracking systems. This review study aims to discuss contemporary research and development in vision-based sensing for surgical navigation. The selected review materials are expected to provide a comprehensive appreciation of state-of-the-art technology and technical issues enabling holistic discussions of the challenges and knowledge gaps in contemporary development. Original views on the significance and development prospect of vision-based sensing in surgical navigation are presented.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks enable highly accurate image segmentation, but require large amounts of manually annotated data for supervised training. Few-shot learning aims to address this shortcoming by learning a new class from a few annotated support examples. We introduce, a novel few-shot framework, for the segmentation of volumetric medical images with only a few annotated slices. Compared to other related works in computer vision, the major challenges are the absence of pre-trained networks and the volumetric nature of medical scans. We address these challenges by proposing a new architecture for few-shot segmentation that incorporates ‘squeeze {\&} excite' blocks. Our two-armed architecture consists of a conditioner arm, which processes the annotated support input and generates a task-specific representation. This representation is passed on to the segmenter arm that uses this information to segment the new query image. To facilitate efficient interaction between the conditioner and the segmenter arm, we propose to use ‘channel squeeze {\&} spatial excitation' blocks – a light-weight computational module – that enables heavy interaction between both the arms with negligible increase in model complexity. This contribution allows us to perform image segmentation without relying on a pre-trained model, which generally is unavailable for medical scans. Furthermore, we propose an efficient strategy for volumetric segmentation by optimally pairing a few slices of the support volume to all the slices of the query volume. We perform experiments for organ segmentation on whole-body contrast-enhanced CT scans from the Visceral Dataset. Our proposed model outperforms multiple baselines and existing approaches with respect to the segmentation accuracy by a significant margin.

Specifically, we employ simple evolutionary techniques at unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions and reaching accuracies of 94.6{\%} (95.6{\%} for ensemble) and 77.0{\%}, respectively.

It is based on results from the "MICCAI 2007 Grand Challenge" workshop, where 16 teams evaluated their algorithms on a common database. A collection of 20 clinical images with reference segmentations was provided to train and tune algorithms in advance. Participants were also allowed to use additional proprietary training data for that purpose. All teams then had to apply their methods to 10 test datasets and submit the obtained results. Employed algorithms include statistical shape models, atlas registration, level-sets, graph-cuts and rule-based systems. All results were compared to reference segmentations five error measures that highlight different aspects of segmentation accuracy. All measures were combined according to a specific scoring system relating the obtained values to human expert variability. In general, interactive methods reached higher average scores than automatic approaches and featured a better consistency of segmentation quality. However, the best automatic methods (mainly based on statistical shape models with some additional free deformation) could compete well on the majority of test images. The study provides an insight in performance of different segmentation approaches under real-world conditions and highlights achievements and limitations of current image analysis techniques. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

In particular, this is achieved by leveraging a feature-centric voting scheme to implement novel convolutional layers which explicitly exploit the sparsity encountered in the input. To this end, we examine the trade-off between accuracy and speed for different architectures and additionally propose to use an L1 penalty on the filter activations to further encourage sparsity in the intermediate representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose sparse convolutional layers and L1 regularisation for efficient large-scale processing of 3D data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the KITTI object detection benchmark and show that VoteSDeep models with as few as three layers outperform the previous state of the art in both laser and laser-vision based approaches by margins of up to 40{\%} while remaining highly competitive in terms of processing time.},

abstract = {The idea of using evolutionary computation to train artificial neural networks, or neuroevolution (NE), for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks has now been around for over 20 years. However, as RL tasks become more challenging, the networks required become larger, so do their genomes. But, scaling NE to large nets (i.e. tens of thousands of weights) is infeasible using direct encodings that map genes one-to-one to network components. In this paper, we scale-up our "compressed" network encoding where network weight matrices are represented indirectly as a set of Fourier-type coefficients, to tasks that require very-large networks due to the high-dimensionality of their input space. The approach is demonstrated successfully on two reinforcement learning tasks in which the control networks receive visual input: (1) a vision-based version of the octopus control task requiring networks with over 3 thousand weights, and (2) a version of the TORCS driving game where networks with over 1 million weights are evolved to drive a car around a track using video images from the driver's perspective.

abstract = {Staining and scanning of tissue samples for microscopic examination is fraught with undesirable color variations arising from differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques of stain vendors, staining protocols of labs, and color responses of digital scanners. When comparing tissue samples, color normalization and stain separation of the tissue images can be helpful for both pathologists and software. Techniques that are used for natural images fail to utilize structural properties of stained tissue samples and produce undesirable color distortions. The stain concentration cannot be negative. Tissue samples are stained with only a few stains and most tissue regions are characterized by at most one effective stain. We model these physical phenomena that define the tissue structure by first decomposing images in an unsupervised manner into stain density maps that are sparse and non-negative. For a given image, we combine its stain density maps with stain color basis of a pathologist-preferred target image, thus altering only its color while preserving its structure described by the maps. Stain density correlation with ground truth and preference by pathologists were higher for images normalized using our method when compared to other alternatives. We also propose a computationally faster extension of this technique for large whole-slide images that selects an appropriate patch sample instead of using the entire image to compute the stain color basis.},

abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common accompaniment of ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting.

abstract = {Purpose: To compare performance of a deep-learning enhanced algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), to the previously published performance of that algorithm, the Iowa Detection Program (IDP)-without deep learning components-on the same publicly available set of fundus images and previously reported consensus reference standard set, by three US Board certified retinal specialists. Methods: We used the previously reported consensus reference standard of referable DR (rDR), defined as International Clinical Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy moderate, severe nonproliferative (NPDR), proliferative DR, and/or macular edema (ME). Neither Messidor-2 images, nor the three retinal specialists setting the Messidor-2 reference standard were used for training IDx-DR version X2.1. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, area under the curve (AUC), and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Sensitivity was 96.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 93.3{\%}-98.8{\%}), specificity was 87.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 84.2{\%}-89.4{\%}), with 6/874 false negatives, resulting in a negative predictive value of 99.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 97.8{\%}-99.6{\%}). No cases of severe NPDR, PDR, or ME were missed. The AUC was 0.980 (95{\%} CI: 0.968-0.992). Sensitivity was not statistically different from published IDP sensitivity, which had a CI of 94.4{\%} to 99.3{\%}, but specificity was significantly better than the published IDP specificity CI of 55.7{\%} to 63.0{\%}. Conclusions: A deep-learning enhanced algorithm for the automated detection of DR, achieves significantly better performance than a previously reported, otherwise essentially identical, algorithm that does not employ deep learning. Deep learning enhanced algorithms have the potential to improve the efficiency of DR screening, and thereby to prevent visual loss and blindness from this devastating disease.},

abstract = {Significance: Speckle noise is an inherent limitation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images that makes clinical interpretation challenging. The recent emergence of deep learning could offer a reliable method to reduce noise in OCT images. Aim: We sought to investigate the use of deep features (VGG) to limit the effect of blurriness and increase perceptual sharpness and to evaluate its impact on the performance of OCT image denoising (DnCNN). Approach: Fifty-one macula-centered OCT pairs were used in training of the network. Another set of 20 OCT pair was used for testing. The DnCNN model was cascaded with a VGG network that acted as a perceptual loss function instead of the traditional losses of L1 and L2. The VGG network remains fixed during the training process. We focused on the individual layers of the VGG-16 network to decipher the contribution of each distinctive layer as a loss function to produce denoised OCT images that were perceptually sharp and that preserved the faint features (retinal layer boundaries) essential for interpretation. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), edge-preserving index, and no-reference image sharpness/blurriness [perceptual sharpness index (PSI), just noticeable blur (JNB), and spectral and spatial sharpness measure (S3)] metrics were used to compare deep feature losses with the traditional losses. Results: The deep feature loss produced images with high perceptual sharpness measures at the cost of less smoothness (PSNR) in OCT images. The deep feature loss outperformed the traditional losses (L1 and L2) for all of the evaluation metrics except for PSNR. The PSI, S3, and JNB estimates of deep feature loss performance were 0.31, 0.30, and 16.53, respectively. For L1 and L2 losses performance, the PSI, S3, and JNB were 0.21 and 0.21, 0.17 and 0.16, and 14.46 and 14.34, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrate the potential of deep feature loss in denoising OCT images. Our preliminary findings suggest research directions for further investigation. {\textcopyright} The Authors.

abstract = {The biomedical sciences characteristically deal with huge masses of data, which must be organized, reduced, analyzed, and generally processed in many different ways.1 Much of this data is in the form of pictures: photomicrographs, electron micrographs, X-ray films, Schlieren photographs, X-ray diffraction patterns, autoradiographs, time-lapse films, cineradiographs, or the like. Individual pictures hold a great wealth of precise numerical information, such as the morphological and structural characteristics of lengths, areas, volumes, and densities. From sequences of pictures, quantitative results can be derived, such as the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of trajectories. Such pictures relate to almost every field of biomedical research: chromosome karyograms in cytogenetics, angiogram cineradiographs in cardiology, Schlieren photographs in ultracentrifugal molecular-weight determinations, autoradiographs of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the study of leukemia, Golgi-stained neuron photomicrographs in the study of the ontogeny and phylogeny of the brain, X rays of bones in studies of calcium density distribution in orthopedic diseases, X rays of epiphysial plates of the hand in investigations of accurate physiological age, X-ray crystallographic plates in protein structure determination, electron micrographs in the investigation of the fine structure of virus particles, motion pictures of marine crustaceans in the detection of their sensitivity to polarized light, tissue-culture time-lapse films in the investigation of cancer-cell motility, and many others. In this paper we shall describe selected illustrations of work already accomplished by the authors in the pattern-recognition analysis of biomedical pictures. The technique involves two main steps: first, a scanning instrument, called FIDAC (Film Input to Digital Automatic Computer), scans the picture on-line into the high-speed memory of a digital computer; second, two computer programming systems (called FIDACSYS and BUGSYS) are used to recognize the objects to be measured and to process the quantitative data, according to the requirements of the particular biological or medical problem under consideration. This FIDAC system was designed specifically for the processing of biomedical pictures.},

abstract = {Radiomics has shown promise in improving models for predicting patient outcomes. However, to maximize the information gain of the radiomics features, especially in larger patient cohorts, the variability in radiomics features owing to differences between scanners and scanning protocols must be accounted for. To this aim, the imaging variability of radiomics feature values was evaluated on 100 computed tomography scanners at 35 clinics by imaging a radiomics phantom using a controlled protocol and the commonly used chest and head protocols of the local clinic. We used a linear mixed-effects model to determine the degree to which the manufacturer and individual scanners contribute to the overall variability. Using a controlled protocol reduced the overall variability by 57{\%} and 52{\%} compared to the local chest and head protocols respectively. The controlled protocol also reduced the relative contribution of the manufacturer to the total variability. For almost all variabilities (manufacturer, scanner, and residual with different preprocesssing), the controlled protocol scans had a significantly smaller variability than the local protocol scans did. For most radiomics features, the imaging variability was small relative to the inter-patient feature variability in non–small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient cohorts. From this study, we conclude that using controlled scans can reduce the variability in radiomics features, and our results demonstrate the importance of using controlled protocols in prospective radiomics studies.},

Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.1},

abstract = {Tumor segmentation in PET and CT images is notoriously challenging due to the low spatial resolution in PET and low contrast in CT images. In this paper, we have proposed a general framework to use both PET and CT images simultaneously for tumor segmentation. Our method utilizes the strength of each imaging modality: the superior contrast of PET and the superior spatial resolution of CT. We formulate this problem as a Markov Random Field (MRF) based segmentation of the image pair with a regularized term that penalizes the segmentation difference between PET and CT. Our method simulates the clinical practice of delineating tumor simultaneously using both PET and CT, and is able to concurrently segment tumor from both modalities, achieving globally optimal solutions in low-order polynomial time by a single maximum flow computation. The method was evaluated on clinically relevant tumor segmentation problems. The results showed that our method can effectively make use of both PET and CT image information, yielding segmentation accuracy of 0.85 in Dice similarity coefficient and the average median hausdorff distance (HD) of 6.4 mm, which is 10 {\%} (resp., 16 {\%}) improvement compared to the graph cuts method solely using the PET (resp., CT) images. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

CNN demonstrates ability to train (despite overfitting) on the pre-processed dataset obtained after lung segmentation in contrast to the original not-segmented dataset. Lossless data augmentation of the segmented dataset leads to the lowest validation loss (without overfitting) and nearly the same accuracy (within the limits of standard deviation) in comparison to the original and other pre-processed datasets after lossy data augmentation. The additional limited lossy data augmentation results in the lower validation loss, but with a decrease of the validation accuracy. In conclusion, besides the more complex deep CNNs and bigger datasets, the better progress of CADx for the small and not well-balanced datasets even could be obtained by better segmentation, data augmentation, dataset stratification, and exclusion of non-evident outliers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE. Breast mass detection in mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an essential step in computerized breast cancer analysis. Deep learning-based methods incorporate feature extraction and model learning into a unified framework and have achieved impressive performance in various medical applications (e.g., disease diagnosis, tumor detection, and landmark detection). However, these methods require large-scale accurately annotated data. Unfortunately, it is challenging to get precise annotations of breast masses. To address this issue, we propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) based heatmap regression method for breast mass detection, using only weakly annotated mass regions in mammography images. Specifically, we first generate heat maps of masses based on human-annotated rough regions for breast masses. We then develop an FCN model for end-to-end heatmap regression with an F-score loss function, where the mammography images are regarded as the input and heatmaps for breast masses are used as the output. Finally, the probability map of mass locations can be estimated with the trained model. Experimental results on a mammography dataset with 439 subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we evaluate whether we can use mammography data to improve detection models for DBT, since mammography shares similar structure with tomosynthesis. We propose a transfer learning strategy by fine-tuning the learned FCN model from mammography images.

abstract = {The classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using deep learning methods has shown promising results, but successful application in clinical settings requires a combination of high accuracy, short processing time, and generalizability to various populations. In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD classification algorithm using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from AD patients and age/gender-matched cognitively normal controls from two populations that differ in ethnicity and education level. These populations come from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each population, we trained CNNs on five subsets using coronal slices of T1-weighted images that cover the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated the models on validation subsets from both the same population (within-dataset validation) and other population (between-dataset validation). Our models achieved average areas under the curves of 0.91–0.94 for within-dataset validation and 0.88–0.89 for between-dataset validation. The mean processing time per person was 23–24 s. The within-dataset and between-dataset performances were comparable between the ADNI-derived and SNUBH-derived models. These results demonstrate the generalizability of our models to different patients with different ethnicities and education levels, as well as their potential for deployment as fast and accurate diagnostic support tools for AD.},

abstract = {Background: Accurate and noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, including IDH1 and IDH2) status is clinically meaningful for molecular stratification of glioma, but remains challenging. Purpose: To establish a model for classifying IDH status in gliomas based on multiparametric MRI. Study Type: Retrospective, radiomics. Population: In all, 105 consecutive cases of grade II–IV glioma with 50 IDH1 or IDH2 mutant (IDHm) and 55 IDH wildtype (IDHw) were separated into a training cohort (n = 73) and a test cohort (n = 32). Field Strength/Sequence: Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1W), T2-weighted (T2W), and arterial spin labeling (ASL) images were acquired at 3.0T. Assessment: Two doctors manually labeled the volume of interest (VOI) on CE-T1W, then T2W and ASL were coregistered to CE-T1W. A total of 851 radiomics features were extracted on each VOI of three sequences. From the training cohort, all radiomics features with age and gender were processed by the Mann–Whitney U-test, Pearson test, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to obtain optimal feature groups to train support vector machine models. The accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of all models for classifying the IDH status were calculated on the test cohort. Two subtasks were performed to verify the efficiency of texture features and the Pearson test in IDH status classification, respectively. Statistical Tests: The permutation test with Bonferroni correction; chi-square test. Results: The accuracy and AUC of the classifier, which combines the features of all three sequences, achieved 0.823 and 0.770 (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. The best model established by texture features only had an AUC of 0.819 and an accuracy of 0.761. The best model established without the Pearson test got an AUC of 0.747 and an accuracy of 0.719. Data Conclusion: IDH genotypes of glioma can be identified by radiomics features from multiparameter MRI. The Pearson test improved the performance of the IDH classification models. Level of Evidence: 4. Technical Efficacy Stage: 1.},

abstract = {Breast cancer screening is one of the most common radiological tasks with over 39 million exams performed each year. While breast cancer screening has been one of the most studied medical imaging applications of artificial intelligence, the development and evaluation of the algorithms are hindered due to the lack of well-annotated large-scale publicly available datasets. This is particularly an issue for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) which is a relatively new breast cancer screening modality. We have curated and made publicly available a large-scale dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis images. It contains 22,032 reconstructed DBT volumes belonging to 5,610 studies from 5,060 patients. This included four groups: (1) 5,129 normal studies, (2) 280 studies where additional imaging was needed but no biopsy was performed, (3) 112 benign biopsied studies, and (4) 89 studies with cancer. Our dataset included masses and architectural distortions which were annotated by two experienced radiologists. Additionally, we developed a single-phase deep learning detection model and tested it using our dataset to serve as a baseline for future research. Our model reached a sensitivity of 65{\%} at 2 false positives per breast. Our large, diverse, and highly-curated dataset will facilitate development and evaluation of AI algorithms for breast cancer screening through providing data for training as well as common set of cases for model validation. The performance of the model developed in our study shows that the task remains challenging and will serve as a baseline for future model development.},

abstract = {Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug worldwide. Cross-sectional neuroimaging studies suggest that chronic cannabis exposure and the development of cannabis use disorders may affect brain morphology. However, cross-sectional studies cannot make a conclusive distinction between cause and consequence and longitudinal neuroimaging studies are lacking. In this prospective study we investigate whether continued cannabis use and higher levels of cannabis exposure in young adults are associated with grey matter reductions. Heavy cannabis users (N = 20, age baseline M = 20.5, SD = 2.1) and non-cannabis using healthy controls (N = 22, age baseline M = 21.6, SD = 2.45) underwent a comprehensive psychological assessment and a T1- structural MRI scan at baseline and 3 years follow-up. Grey matter volumes (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellum) were estimated using the software package SPM (VBM-8 module). Continued cannabis use did not have an effect on GM volume change at follow-up. Cross-sectional analyses at baseline and follow-up revealed consistent negative correlations between cannabis related problems and cannabis use (in grams) and regional GM volume of the left hippocampus, amygdala and superior temporal gyrus. These results suggests that small GM volumes in the medial temporal lobe are a risk factor for heavy cannabis use or that the effect of cannabis on GM reductions is limited to adolescence with no further damage of continued use after early adulthood. Long-term prospective studies starting in early adolescence are needed to reach final conclusions.},

abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small prosimian of growing interest for studies of primate biology and evolution, and notably as a model organism of brain aging. As brain atlases are essential tools for brain investigation, the objective of the current work was to create the first 3D digital atlas of the mouse lemur brain. For this, a template image was constructed from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 animals. This template was then manually segmented into 40 cortical, 74 subcortical and 6 cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) regions. Additionally, we generated probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF. The template, manual segmentation and probability maps, as well as imaging tools used to create and manipulate the template, can all be freely downloaded. The atlas was first used to automatically assess regional age-associated cerebral atrophy in a cohort of mouse lemurs previously studied by voxel based morphometry (VBM). Results based on the atlas were in good agreement with the VBM ones, showing age-associated atrophy in the same brain regions such as the insular, parietal or occipital cortices as well as the thalamus or hypothalamus. The atlas was also used as a tool for comparative neuroanatomy. To begin with, we compared measurements of brain regions in our MRI data with histology-based measures from a reference article largely used in previous comparative neuroanatomy studies. We found large discrepancies between our MRI-based data and those of the reference histology-based article. Next, regional brain volumes were compared amongst the mouse lemur and several other mammalian species where high quality volumetric MRI brain atlases were available, including rodents (mouse, rat) and primates (marmoset, macaque, and human). Unlike those based on histological atlases, measures from MRI atlases indicated similar cortical to cerebral volume indices in all primates, including in mouse lemurs, and lower values in mice. On the other hand, white matter to cerebral volume index increased from rodents to small primates (mouse lemurs and marmosets) to macaque, reaching their highest values in humans.},

ITK is a templated C++ library of image processing algorithms and frameworks for biomedical and other applications, and it was designed to be generic, flexible and extensible. Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience.

abstract = {Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways including enabling low-cost serial assessment of cardiac function by non-experts in the primary care and rural setting. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram (echo) interpretation. Our approach entailed: 1) preprocessing of complete echo studies; 2) convolutional neural networks (CNN) for view identification, image segmentation, and phasing of the cardiac cycle; 3) quantification of chamber volumes and left ventricular mass; 4) particle tracking to compute longitudinal strain; and 5) targeted disease detection. CNNs accurately identified views (e.g. 99{\%} for apical 4-chamber) and segmented individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values [e.g. median absolute deviations (MAD) of 11.8 g/kg/m2 for left ventricular mass index and 7.7 mL/kg/m2 for left ventricular diastolic volume index, derived from 1319 and 2918 studies, respectively]. In terms of cardiac function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values [for ejection fraction, MAD=5.3{\%}, N=3101 studies; for strain, MAD=1.5{\%} (n=197) and 1.6{\%} (n=110)], and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of breast cancer patients for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found that, compared to manual measurements, automated measurements had superior performance across seven internal consistency metrics (e.g. the correlation of left ventricular diastolic volumes with left atrial volumes) with an average increase in the absolute Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.05 (p=0.02). Finally, we used CNNs to develop disease detection algorithms for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis, with C-statistics of 0.93 and 0.84, respectively. Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support point-of-care handheld cardiac ultrasound and large-scale analysis of the millions of echos archived within healthcare systems.},

Methods This study considered retrospective data from 23 biopsy confirmed prostate cancer patients who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI before radical prostatectomy (RP). Representative slices from RP specimens were stained with vascular marker CD31. Tumor extent was mapped from RP sections onto DCE MRI using nonlinear registration methods. Seventy-seven microvessel QH features and 18 DCE MRI kinetic features were extracted and evaluated for their ability to distinguish low from intermediate and high GS. The effect of temporal sampling on kinetic features was assessed and correlations between those robust to temporal resolution and microvessel features discriminative of GS were examined. Results A total of 12 microvessel architectural features were discriminative of low and intermediate/high grade tumors with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) {\textgreater} 0.7. These features were most highly correlated with mean washout gradient (WG) (max rho = -0.62). Independent analysis revealed WG to be moderately robust to temporal resolution (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.63) and WG variance, which was poorly correlated with microvessel features, to be predictive of low grade tumors (AUC = 0.77). Enhancement ratio was the most robust (ICC = 0.96) and discriminative (AUC = 0.78) kinetic feature but was moderately correlated with microvessel features (max rho = -0.52). Conclusion Computer extracted features of prostate DCE MRI appear to be correlated with microvessel architecture and may be discriminative of low versus intermediate and high GS.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of accurate cortical surfaces with minimal topological errors (i.e., handles and holes) from infant brain MR images is important in early brain development studies. However, infant brain MR images usually exhibit extremely low tissue contrast (especially from 3 to 9 months of age) and dynamic imaging appearance patterns. Thus, it is inevitable to have large amounts of topological errors in the infant brain tissue segmentation results, thus leading to inaccurate surface reconstruction. To address these issues, inspired by recent advances in deep learning methods, we propose an anatomically constrained U-Net method for topological correction of infant cortical surfaces. Specifically, in our method, we first extract candidate voxels with potential topological errors, by leveraging a topology-preserving level set method. Then, we propose a U-Net with anatomical constraints to correct those located candidate voxels. Due to the fact that infant cortical surfaces often contain large handles or holes, it is difficult to completely correct all errors using one-shot correction. Therefore, we further gather these two steps into an iterative framework to correct large topological errors gradually. To our knowledge, this is the first work introducing deep learning for infant cortical topological correction. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art method on infant cortical topology and show the superior performance of our method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been popularly used to solve the problem of cell/nuclei classification and segmentation in histopathology images. Despite their pervasiveness, CNNs are fine-tuned on specific, large and labeled datasets as these datasets are hard to collect and annotate. However, this is not a scalable approach. In this work, we aim to gain deeper insights into the nature of the problem. We used a cervical cancer dataset with cells labeled into four classes by an expert pathologist. By employing pre-training on this dataset, we propose a one-shot learning model for cervical cell classification in histopathology tissue images. We extract regional maximum activation of convolutions (R-MAC) global descriptors and train a one-shot learning memory module with the goal of using it for various cancer types and eliminate the need for expensive, difficult to collect, large, labeled whole slide image (WSI) datasets. Our model achieved 94.6{\%} accuracy in detecting the four cell classes on the test dataset. Further, we present our analysis of the dataset and features to better understand and visualize the problem in general.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare and evaluate different testing protocols used for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis from X-Ray images in the recent literature. We show that similar results can be obtained using X-Ray images that do not contain most of the lungs. We are able to remove the lungs from the images by turning to black the center of the X-Ray scan and training our classifiers only on the outer part of the images. Hence, we deduce that several testing protocols for the recognition are not fair and that the neural networks are learning patterns in the dataset that are not correlated to the presence of COVID-19. Finally, we show that creating a fair testing protocol is a challenging task, and we provide a method to measure how fair a specific testing protocol is. In the future research we suggest to check the fairness of a testing protocol using our tools and we encourage researchers to look for better techniques than the ones that we propose.},

abstract = {Osteosarcoma is one of the most common types of bone cancer in children. To gauge the extent of cancer treatment response in the patient after surgical resection, the H{\&}E stained image slides are manually evaluated by pathologists to estimate the percentage of necrosis, a time consuming process prone to observer bias and inaccuracy. Digital image analysis is a potential method to automate this process, thus saving time and providing a more accurate evaluation. The slides are scanned in Aperio Scanscope, converted to digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and stored in SVS format. These are high resolution images, of the order of 10 9 pixels, allowing up to 40X magnification factor. This paper proposes an image segmentation and analysis technique for segmenting tumor and non-tumor regions in histopathological WSIs of osteosarcoma datasets. Our approach is a combination of pixel-based and object-based methods which utilize tumor properties such as nuclei cluster, density, and circularity to classify tumor regions as viable and non-viable. A K-Means clustering technique is used for tumor isolation using color normalization, followed by multi-threshold Otsu segmentation technique to further classify tumor region as viable and non-viable. Then a Flood-fill algorithm is applied to cluster similar pixels into cellular objects and compute cluster data for further analysis of regions under study. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive solution that is able to produce such a classification for Osteosarcoma cancer. The results are very conclusive in identifying viable and non-viable tumor regions. In our experiments, the accuracy of the discussed approach is 100{\%} in viable tumor and coagulative necrosis identification while it is around 90{\%} for fibrosis and acellular/hypocellular tumor osteoid, for all the sampled datasets used. We expect the developed software to lead to a significant increase in accuracy and decrease in inter-observer variability in assessment of necrosis by the pathologists and a reduction in the time spent by the pathologists in such assessments.},

Beyond helping CNNs to handle long-range dependencies, Ramachandran et al. (2019) showed that attention can completely replace convolution and achieve state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. This raises the question: Do learned attention layers operate similarly to convolutional layers? This work provides evidence that attention layers can perform convolution and, indeed, they often learn to do so in practice. Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as expressive as any convolutional layer. Our numerical experiments then show that self-attention layers attend to pixel-grid patterns similarly to CNN layers, corroborating our analysis. Our code is publicly available.},

abstract = {Attention dysfunction is a common but often undiagnosed cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease that significantly reduces quality of life. We sought to increase understanding of the mechanisms underlying attention dysfunction using functional neuroimaging. Functional MRI was acquired at two repeated sessions in the resting state and during the Attention Network Test, for 25 non-demented subjects with Parkinson's disease and 21 healthy controls. Behavioral and MRI contrasts were calculated for alerting, orienting, and executive control components of attention. Brain regions showing group differences in attention processing were used as seeds in a functional connectivity analysis of a separate resting state run. Parkinson's disease subjects showed more activation during increased executive challenge in four regions of the dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks, namely right frontal eye field, left and right intraparietal sulcus, and precuneus. In three regions we saw reduced resting state connectivity to the default mode network. Further, whereas higher task activation in the right intraparietal sulcus correlated with reduced resting state connectivity between right intraparietal sulcus and the precuneus in healthy controls, this relationship was absent in Parkinson's disease subjects. Our results suggest that a weakened interaction between the default mode and task positive networks might alter the way in which the executive response is processed in PD.},

The core idea is to adopt a spatial distribution matrix to define how the image patches are pooled together. By formulating the pooling distribution learning and classifier training jointly, our method can extract multiple spatial layouts of arbitrary shapes rather than regular rectangular regions. By proper mathematical transformation, the distributions can be learned via a boosting-like algorithm, which improves the efficiency of learning especially for large distribution matrices. Further, our method allows category-specific pooling operations to take advantage of the different spatial layouts of different categories.

abstract = {This study aims at developing a joint FDG-PET and MRI texture-based model for the early evaluation of lung metastasis risk in soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs). We investigate if the creation of new composite textures from the combination of FDG-PET and MR imaging information could better identify aggressive tumours. Towards this goal, a cohort of 51 patients with histologically proven STSs of the extremities was retrospectively evaluated. All patients had pre-treatment FDG-PET and MRI scans comprised of T1-weighted and T2-weighted fat-suppression sequences (T2FS). Nine non-texture features (SUV metrics and shape features) and forty-one texture features were extracted from the tumour region of separate (FDG-PET, T1 and T2FS) and fused (FDG-PET/T1 and FDG-PET/T2FS) scans. Volume fusion of the FDG-PET and MRI scans was implemented using the wavelet transform. The influence of six different extraction parameters on the predictive value of textures was investigated. The incorporation of features into multivariable models was performed using logistic regression. The multivariable modeling strategy involved imbalance-adjusted bootstrap resampling in the following four steps leading to final prediction model construction: (1) feature set reduction; (2) feature selection; (3) prediction performance estimation; and (4) computation of model coefficients. Univariate analysis showed that the isotropic voxel size at which texture features were extracted had the most impact on predictive value. In multivariable analysis, texture features extracted from fused scans significantly outperformed those from separate scans in terms of lung metastases prediction estimates. The best performance was obtained using a combination of four texture features extracted from FDG-PET/T1 and FDG-PET/T2FS scans. This model reached an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.984 ± 0.002, a sensitivity of 0.955 ± 0.006, and a specificity of 0.926 ± 0.004 in bootstrapping evaluations. Ultimately, lung metastasis risk assessment at diagnosis of STSs could improve patient outcomes by allowing better treatment adaptation.},

@article{Kulkarni2016,
abstract = {Learning robust value functions given raw observations and rewards is now possible with model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms. There is a third alternative, called Successor Representations (SR), which decomposes the value function into two components -- a reward predictor and a successor map. The successor map represents the expected future state occupancy from any given state and the reward predictor maps states to scalar rewards. The value function of a state can be computed as the inner product between the successor map and the reward weights. In this paper, we present DSR, which generalizes SR within an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework. DSR has several appealing properties including: increased sensitivity to distal reward changes due to factorization of reward and world dynamics, and the ability to extract bottleneck states (subgoals) given successor maps trained under a random policy. We show the efficacy of our approach on two diverse environments given raw pixel observations -- simple grid-world domains (MazeBase) and the Doom game engine.},

abstract = {In the early days, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) was studied with global features. Since 2003, image retrieval based on local descriptors (de facto SIFT) has been extensively studied for over a decade due to the advantage of SIFT in dealing with image transformations. Recently, image representations based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have attracted increasing interest in the community and demonstrated impressive performance. Given this time of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of instance retrieval over the last decade. Two broad categories, SIFT-based and CNN-based methods, are presented. For the former, according to the codebook size, we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks. For the latter, we discuss three lines of methods, i.e., using pre-trained or fine-tuned CNN models, and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-pass of an image to the network, while the last category employs a patch-based feature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instance retrieval, reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories, and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods. After analyzing and comparing retrieval performance of different categories on several datasets, we discuss promising directions towards generic and specialized instance retrieval.},

abstract = {Histopathology image analysis serves as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. Efficient and precise diagnosis is quite critical for the subsequent therapeutic treatment of patients. So far, computer-aided diagnosis has not been widely applied in pathological field yet as currently well-addressed tasks are only the tip of the iceberg. Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a quite challenging problem. First, the scarcity of annotations heavily impedes the pace of developing effective approaches. Pixelwise delineated annotations on WSIs are time consuming and tedious, which poses difficulties in building a large-scale training dataset. In addition, a variety of heterogeneous patterns of tumor existing in high magnification field are actually the major obstacle. Furthermore, a gigapixel scale WSI cannot be directly analyzed due to the immeasurable computational cost. How to design the weakly supervised learning methods to maximize the use of available WSI-level labels that can be readily obtained in clinical practice is quite appealing. To overcome these challenges, we present a weakly supervised approach in this article for fast and effective classification on the whole slide lung cancer images. Our method first takes advantage of a patch-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to retrieve discriminative blocks and provides representative deep features with high efficiency. Then, different context-aware block selection and feature aggregation strategies are explored to generate globally holistic WSI descriptor which is ultimately fed into a random forest (RF) classifier for the image-level prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to exploit the potential of image-level labels along with some coarse annotations for weakly supervised learning. A large-scale lung cancer WSI dataset is constructed in this article for evaluation, which validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method that surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin with an accuracy of 97.3{\%}. In addition, our method also achieves the best performance on the public lung cancer WSIs dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We highlight that a small number of coarse annotations can contribute to further accuracy improvement. We believe that weakly supervised learning methods have great potential to assist pathologists in histology image diagnosis in the near future.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

abstract = {Alterations in the geometry and function of the heart define well-established causes of cardiovascular disease. However, current approaches to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases often rely on subjective human assessment as well as manual analysis of medical images. Both factors limit the sensitivity in quantifying complex structural and functional phenotypes. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved success for tasks such as classification or segmentation of medical images, but lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes, limiting their value in clinical diagnosis. In this work, we propose a 3D convolutional generative model for automatic classification of images from patients with cardiac diseases associated with structural remodeling. The model leverages interpretable task-specific anatomic patterns learned from 3D segmentations. It further allows to visualise and quantify the learned pathology-specific remodeling patterns in the original input space of the images. This approach yields high accuracy in the categorization of healthy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subjects when tested on unseen MR images from our own multi-centre dataset (100{\%}) as well on the ACDC MICCAI 2017 dataset (90{\%}). We believe that the proposed deep learning approach is a promising step towards the development of interpretable classifiers for the medical imaging domain, which may help clinicians to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient risk-stratification.},

abstract = {Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralized model while training data remains distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections. We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each round, each client independently computes an update to the current model based on its local data, and communicates this update to a central server, where the client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional and recurrent networks show that the proposed methods can reduce the communication cost by two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning for partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) is a challenge as it requires policies with an internal state. Traditional approaches suffer significantly from this shortcoming and usually make strong assumptions on the problem domain such as perfect system models, state-estimators and a Markovian hidden system. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer a natural framework for dealing with policy learning using hidden state and require only few limiting assumptions. As they can be trained well using gradient descent, they are suited for policy gradient approaches. In this paper, we present a policy gradient method, the Recurrent Policy Gradient which constitutes a model-free reinforcement learning method. It is aimed at training limited-memory stochastic policies on problems which require long-term memories of past observations. The approach involves approximating a policy gradient for a recurrent neural network by backpropagating return-weighted characteristic eligibilities through time. Using a "Long Short-Term Memory" RNN architecture, we are able to outperform previous RL methods on three important benchmark tasks. Furthermore, we show that using history-dependent baselines helps reducing estimation variance significantly, thus enabling our approach to tackle more challenging, highly stochastic environments. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

abstract = {The rapidly emerging field of computational pathology has the potential to enable objective diagnosis, therapeutic response prediction and identification of new morphological features of clinical relevance. However, deep learning-based computational pathology approaches either require manual annotation of gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in fully-supervised settings or thousands of WSIs with slide-level labels in a weakly-supervised setting. Moreover, whole slide level computational pathology methods also suffer from domain adaptation, interpretability and visualization issues. These challenges have prevented the broad adaptation of computational pathology for clinical and research purposes. Here we present CLAM - Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple instance learning (https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM), an easy-to-use, high-throughput and interpretable WSI-level processing and learning method that only requires slide-level labels while being data efficient, adaptable and capable of handling multi-class subtyping problems. CLAM is a deep-learning based weakly-supervised method that uses attention-based learning to automatically identify sub-regions of high diagnostic value in order to accurately classify the whole slide, while also utilizing instance-level clustering over the representative regions identified to constrain and refine the feature space. In three separate analyses, we demonstrate the data efficiency and adaptability of CLAM and its superior performance over standard weakly-supervised classification. We demonstrate that CLAM models are interpretable and can be used to identify well-known and new morphological features without using any spatial labels during training. We further show that models trained using CLAM are adaptable to independent test cohorts, cell phone microscopy images, and varying slide tissue content. CLAM is a flexible, general purpose, and adaptable method that can be used for a variety of different computational pathology tasks in both clinical and research settings.},

Standard semi-quantitative scoring approaches, however, are coarse-grained and lack precise neuroanatomic localization.

Using automated segmentation of stained objects and a cloud-based interface, we annotate {\textgreater} 70,000 plaque candidates from 43 whole slide images (WSIs) to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. Networks achieve strong plaque classification on a 10-WSI hold-out set (0.993 and 0.743 areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve, respectively). Prediction confidence maps visualize morphology distributions at high resolution. Resulting network-derived amyloid beta (A$\beta$)-burden scores correlate well with established semi-quantitative scores on a 30-WSI blinded hold-out. Finally, saliency mapping demonstrates that networks learn patterns agreeing with accepted pathologic features. This scalable means to augment a neuropathologist's ability suggests a route to neuropathologic deep phenotyping.},

abstract = {Background: In light of failed efforts to intensify treatment based on tumor necrosis after 10- weeks of chemotherapy, a novel biomarker to predict or measure response is critically needed to develop new therapies for patients with osteosarcoma. Objectives:We hypothesize that such a biomarker can be discovered by combining the emerging virtual microscopy technology of whole-slide digital imaging with computer-based image pattern recognition algorithms. Initial development of the biomarker would be based on histological features of tumor response. Design/Method: We retrieved data from resection specimens of 50 osteosarcoma patients treated at Children'sMedical Center Dallas between 1995-2015.We implemented a multi-step process to develop an automated image analysis protocol for histological features that involved digitalization of all slides, development of an image visualization and navigation tool, and an image segmentation and processing module for extracting major features within an image. Results: Tumor preparation: all resected tumors were prepared for histological evaluation with standard procedures that are briefly summarized. After surgical resection, each patient tumor was bisected in the plane predicted to provide the largest surface area for histology slide preparation. Using a pre-determined grid, each area within the grid was harvested to produce one slide (20-50 slides/patient). Using an Aperio scanner, we digitalized all histology slides for each patient, within which digitalized slides retain histological details from 2x to 20x magnification (each 20x image = 1 tile). Since each digitalized whole slide has approximately 4000 tiles, each patient whole tumor is represented by approximately 200,000 tiles.Main image processing algorithm development: Two-hundred image tiles were specifically identified from 3 patients' cases, to represent the main tumor features. An image segmentation pipeline was then designed and implemented to differentiate tumor from non-tumor and viable tumor from nonviable tumor based on color, shape, and cellular density characteristics. Implementing Color segmentation for chromatically distinct regions, and threshold segmentation using Multi-Otsu with clustering and contouring of segmented images for shape and density analysis, we completed the initial image analysis protocol. Using a flood-fill algorithm applied to pixels, cell counts, and cell density, we identified viable tumor and coagulative necrosis with 100{\%} accuracy, fibrosis with 93{\%} accuracy, and tumor osteoid with 89{\%} accuracy. We then identified 2,500 tiles based on a stratified random sample approach to train and validate a set of machine learning algorithms. These efforts are ongoing. Conclusion: We have completed the first phase necessary to automate the interpretation of histological features of tumor response in osteosarcoma.},

The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669. ±. 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Suinesiaputra2018,
abstract = {Statistical shape modeling is a powerful tool for visualizing and quantifying geometric and functional patterns of the heart. After myocardial infarction (MI), the left ventricle typically remodels in response to physiological challenges. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to describe statistical shape changes. Which method best characterizes the left ventricular remodeling after MI is an open research question. A better descriptor of remodeling is expected to provide a more accurate evaluation of disease status in MI patients. We therefore designed a challenge to test shape characterization in MI given a set of three-dimensional left ventricular surface points. The training set comprised 100 MI patients, and 100 asymptomatic volunteers (AV). The challenge was initiated in 2015 at the Statistical Atlases and Computational Models of the Heart workshop, in conjunction with the MICCAI conference. The training set with labels was provided to participants, who were asked to submit the likelihood of MI from a different (validation) set of 200 cases (100 AV and 100 MI). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used as the outcome measures. The goals of this challenge were to 1) establish a common dataset for evaluating statistical shape modeling algorithms in MI, and 2) test whether statistical shape modeling provides additional information characterizing MI patients over standard clinical measures. Eleven groups with a wide variety of classification and feature extraction approaches participated in this challenge. All methods achieved excellent classification results with accuracy ranges from 0.83 to 0.98. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were all above 0.90. Four methods showed significantly higher performance than standard clinical measures. The dataset and software for evaluation are available from the Cardiac Atlas Project website.11 http://www.cardiacatlas.org.},

abstract = {Few-shot classification aims to recognize novel categories with only few labeled images in each class. Existing metric-based few-shot classification algorithms pre- dict categories by comparing the feature embeddings of query images with those from a few labeled images (support examples) using a learned metric function. While promising performance has been demonstrated, these methods often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to large discrepancy of the feature distribution across domains. In this work, we address the problem of few-shot classification under domain shifts for metric-based methods. Our core idea is to use feature-wise transformation layers for augmenting the image features using affine transforms to simulate various feature distributions under different domains in the training stage. To capture variations of the feature distributions under different domains, we further apply a learning-to-learn approach to search for the hyper-parameters of the feature-wise transformation layers. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies under the domain generalization setting using five few-shot clas- sification datasets: mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, Places, and Plantae. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature-wise transformation layer is appli- cable to various metric-based models, and provides consistent improvements on the few-shot classification performance under domain shift. 1},

abstract = {Learning a sequence of tasks is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. This setting applies to learning systems that observe examples of a range of tasks at different points in time. A learning system should become more knowledgeable as more related tasks are learned. Although the problem of learning sequentially was acknowledged for the first time decades ago, the research in this area has been rather limited. Research in transfer learning, multitask learning, metalearning and deep learning has studied some challenges of these kinds of systems. Recent research in lifelong machine learning and continual learning has revived interest in this problem. We propose Proficiente, a full framework for long-term learning systems. Proficiente relies on knowledge transferred between hypotheses learned with Support Vector Machines. The first component of the framework is focused on transferring forward selectively from a set of existing hypotheses or functions representing knowledge acquired during previous tasks to a new target task. A second component of Proficiente is focused on transferring backward, a novel ability of long-term learning systems that aim to exploit knowledge derived from recent tasks to encourage refinement of existing knowledge. We propose a method that transfers selectively from a task learned recently to existing hypotheses representing previous tasks. The method encourages retention of existing knowledge whilst refining. We analyse the theoretical properties of the proposed framework. Proficiente is accompanied by an agnostic metric that can be used to determine if a long-term learning system is becoming more knowledgeable. We evaluate Proficiente in both synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrate scenarios where knowledgeable supervised learning systems can be achieved by means of transfer.},

Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN architectures such as the U-Net model with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation. Experimental results show that AGs consistently improve the prediction performance of U-Net across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency.

abstract = {A versatile and effective approach to meta-learning is to infer a gradient-based update rule directly from data that promotes rapid learning of new tasks from the same distribution. Current methods rely on backpropagating through the learning process, limiting their scope to few-shot learning. In this work, we introduce Warped Gradient Descent (WarpGrad), a family of modular optimisers that can scale to arbitrary adaptation processes. WarpGrad methods meta-learn to warp task loss surfaces across the joint task-parameter distribution to facilitate gradient descent, which is achieved by a reparametrisation of neural networks that interleaves warp-layers in the architecture. These layers are shared across task learners and fixed during adaptation; they represent a projection of task parameters into a meta-learned space that is conducive to task adaptation and standard backpropagation induces a form of gradient preconditioning. WarpGrad methods are computationally efficient and easy to implement as they rely on parameter sharing and backpropagation. They are readily combined with other meta-learners and can scale both in terms of model size and length of adaptation trajectories as meta-learning warp parameters do not require differentiation through task adaptation processes. We show empirically that WarpGrad optimisers meta-learn a warped space where gradient descent is well behaved, with faster convergence and better performance in a variety of settings, including few-shot, standard supervised, continual, and reinforcement learning.},

An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L2+1) direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

abstract = {The human visual system has the remarkably ability to be able to effortlessly learn novel concepts from only a few examples. Mimicking the same behavior on machine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research problem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In this context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning system that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel categories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not forget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base categories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object recognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight generator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine similarity function between feature representations and classification weight vectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base categories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on 'unseen' categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet where we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition (i.e., we achieve 56.20{\%} and 73.00{\%} on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the base categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack. Finally, we apply our approach on the recently introduced few-shot benchmark of Bharath and Girshick [4] where we also achieve state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in the automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images and their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the adoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring pixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this difficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional segmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a small set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive reweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations commensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to assign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to those of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation ground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how spatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy annotations.},

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of critical anatomical structures is at the core of medical image analysis. The main bottleneck lies in gathering the requisite expert-labeled image annotations in a scalable manner. Methods that permit to produce accurate anatomical structure segmentation without using a large amount of fully annotated training images are highly desirable. In this work, we propose a novel contribution of Contour Transformer Network (CTN), a one-shot anatomy segmentor including a naturally built-in human-in-the-loop mechanism. Segmentation is formulated by learning a contour evolution behavior process based on graph convolutional networks (GCN). Training of our CTN model requires only one labeled image exemplar and leverages additional unlabeled data through newly introduced loss functions that measure the global shape and appearance consistency of contours. We demonstrate that our one-shot learning method significantly outperforms non-learning-based methods and performs competitively to the state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning approaches. With minimal human-in-the-loop editing feedback, the segmentation performance can be further improved and tailored towards the observer desired outcomes. This can facilitate the clinician designed imaging-based biomarker assessments (to support personalized quantitative clinical diagnosis) and outperforms fully supervised baselines.},

The method is based on a set of rules that determine the order in which the organs are isolated and segmented. First, the air-containing organs are segmented: the trachea and the lungs. Then, the organs with high blood content: the spleen, the kidneys and the liver, are segmented. Each organ is individually segmented with a generic four-step pipeline procedure. Our method is unique in that it uses the same generic segmentation approach for all organs and in that it relies on the segmentation difficulty of organs to guide the segmentation process. Experimental results on 20 CT scans of the VISCERAL Anatomy2 Challenge training datasets yield an average Dice volume overlap similarity score of 90.95. For the 10 CT scans test datasets, the average Dice scores is 88.5.},

abstract = {Purpose: Segmentation of the liver from abdominal computed tomography (CT) images is an essential step in some computer-assisted clinical interventions, such as surgery planning for living donor liver transplant, radiotherapy and volume measurement. In this work, we develop a deep learning algorithm with graph cut refinement to automatically segment the liver in CT scans. Methods: The proposed method consists of two main steps: (i) simultaneously liver detection and probabilistic segmentation using 3D convolutional neural network; (ii) accuracy refinement of the initial segmentation with graph cut and the previously learned probability map. Results: The proposed approach was validated on forty CT volumes taken from two public databases MICCAI-Sliver07 and 3Dircadb1. For the MICCAI-Sliver07 test dataset, the calculated mean ratios of volumetric overlap error (VOE), relative volume difference (RVD), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), root-mean-square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) and maximum symmetric surface distance (MSD) are 5.9, 2.7 {\%}, 0.91, 1.88 and 18.94 mm, respectively. For the 3Dircadb1 dataset, the calculated mean ratios of VOE, RVD, ASD, RMSD and MSD are 9.36, 0.97 {\%}, 1.89, 4.15 and 33.14 mm, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed method is fully automatic without any user interaction. Quantitative results reveal that the proposed approach is efficient and accurate for hepatic volume estimation in a clinical setup. The high correlation between the automatic and manual references shows that the proposed method can be good enough to replace the time-consuming and nonreproducible manual segmentation method.},

abstract = {In this study, we present a baseline approach for AutoImplant (https://autoimplant.grand-challenge.org/) – the cranial implant design challenge, which can be formulated as a volumetric shape learning task. In this task, the defective skull, the complete skull and the cranial implant are represented as binary voxel grids. To accomplish this task, the implant can be either reconstructed directly from the defective skull or obtained by taking the difference between a defective skull and a complete skull. In the latter case, a complete skull has to be reconstructed given a defective skull, which defines a volumetric shape completion problem. Our baseline approach for this task is based on the former formulation, i.e., a deep neural network is trained to predict the implants directly from the defective skulls. The approach generates high-quality implants in two steps: First, an encoder-decoder network learns a coarse representation of the implant from downsampled, defective skulls; The coarse implant is only used to generate the bounding box of the defected region in the original high-resolution skull. Second, another encoder-decoder network is trained to generate a fine implant from the bounded area. On the test set, the proposed approach achieves an average dice similarity score (DSC) of 0.8555 and Hausdorff distance (HD) of 5.1825 mm.

abstract = {At the heart of deep learning we aim to use neural networks as function approximators - training them to produce outputs from inputs in emulation of a ground truth function or data creation process. In many cases we only have access to input-output pairs from the ground truth, however it is becoming more common to have access to derivatives of the target output with respect to the input - for example when the ground truth function is itself a neural network such as in network compression or distillation. Generally these target derivatives are not computed, or are ignored. This paper introduces Sobolev Training for neural networks, which is a method for incorporating these target derivatives in addition the to target values while training. By optimising neural networks to not only approximate the function's outputs but also the function's derivatives we encode additional information about the target function within the parameters of the neural network. Thereby we can improve the quality of our predictors, as well as the data-efficiency and generalization capabilities of our learned function approximation. We provide theoretical justifications for such an approach as well as examples of empirical evidence on three distinct domains: regression on classical optimisation datasets, distilling policies of an agent playing Atari, and on large-scale applications of synthetic gradients. In all three domains the use of Sobolev Training, employing target derivatives in addition to target values, results in models with higher accuracy and stronger generalisation.},

abstract = {Automated Lymph Node (LN) detection is an important clinical diagnostic task but very challenging due to the low contrast of surrounding structures in Computed Tomography (CT) and to their varying sizes, poses, shapes and sparsely distributed locations. State-of-the-art studies show the performance range of 52.9{\%} sensitivity at 3.1 false-positives per volume (FP/vol.), or 60.9{\%} at 6.1 FP/vol. for mediastinal LN, by one-shot boosting on 3D HAAR features. In this paper, we first operate a preliminary candidate generation stage, towards ∼100{\%} sensitivity at the cost of high FP levels (∼40 per patient), to harvest volumes of interest (VOI). Our 2.5D approach consequently decomposes any 3D VOI by resampling 2D reformatted orthogonal views N times, via scale, random translations, and rotations with respect to the VOI centroid coordinates. These random views are then used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. In testing, the CNN is employed to assign LN probabilities for all N random views that can be simply averaged (as a set) to compute the final classification probability per VOI. We validate the approach on two datasets: 90 CT volumes with 388 mediastinal LNs and 86 patients with 595 abdominal LNs. We achieve sensitivities of 70{\%}/83{\%} at 3 FP/vol. and 84{\%}/90{\%} at 6 FP/vol. in mediastinum and abdomen respectively, which drastically improves over the previous state-of-the-art work. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

This level of performance corresponds to true positives in 78{\%} and 41{\%} of individual eyes, and false positives in 56{\%} and 17{\%} of individual eyes at the high sensitivity and high specificity points, respectively. Moreover, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can identify anatomical changes before conversion and high-risk subgroups.

abstract = {Predicting treatment medicines is a key aspect of many intelligent healthcare systems. It's a very challenging task due to the following reasons: (1) heterogeneous nature of EHR data that typically include laboratory results, treatment medicines, disease conditions, and demographic details collected from disparate sources; (2) complex correlations among medical sequences, including inter-correlations between sequences and temporal intra-correlations within each sequence; (3) temporal diversity of these correlations, which is highly affected by changing disease progression. We proposes a dual adaptive sequential network, entitled DASNet, to dynamically predict treatment medicines for patients. Specifically, DASNet comprises the following three components. Decomposed Adaptive Long Short-Term Memory network (DA-LSTM) is designed to capture the intra- and inter-correlations in multiple heterogeneous temporal sequences. Then, we develop an Attentive Meta learning Network (AT-MetaNet), which produces location- and context-specific dynamic weight parameters for DA-LSTM, thus enabling it to model the time-varying multi-level correlations. Finally, we employ an ATtentive Fusion Network (AT-FuNet) to retrieve historical information and collectively fuse heterogeneous data representation embeddings to predict treatment medicines. The results of extensive experiments on the public MIMIC-III dataset covering 11 medical conditions demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end model can achieve the state-of-the-art prediction performance while providing clinically useful insights.},

abstract = {Large CNNs have delivered impressive performance in various computer vision applications. But the storage and computation requirements make it problematic for deploying these models on mobile devices. Recently, tensor decompositions have been used for speeding up CNNs. In this paper, we further develop the tensor decomposition technique. We propose a new algorithm for computing the low-rank tensor decomposition for removing the redundancy in the convolution kernels. The algorithm finds the exact global optimizer of the decomposition and is more effective than iterative methods. Based on the decomposition, we further propose a new method for training low-rank constrained CNNs from scratch. Interestingly, while achieving a significant speedup, sometimes the low-rank constrained CNNs delivers significantly better performance than their non-constrained counterparts. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed low-rank NIN model achieves 91.31{\%} accuracy (without data augmentation), which also improves upon state-of-the-art result. We evaluated the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC12 datasets for a variety of modern CNNs, including AlexNet, NIN, VGG and GoogleNet with success. For example, the forward time of VGG-16 is reduced by half while the performance is still comparable. Empirical success suggests that low-rank tensor decompositions can be a very useful tool for speeding up large CNNs.},

abstract = {This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms. {\textcopyright} 1992, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

abstract = {Bayesian optimization has become a successful tool for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or deep neural networks. Despite its success, for large datasets, training and validating a single configuration often takes hours, days, or even weeks, which limits the achievable performance. To accelerate hyperparameter optimization, we propose a generative model for the validation error as a function of training set size, which is learned during the optimization process and allows exploration of preliminary configurations on small subsets, by extrapolating to the full dataset. We construct a Bayesian optimization procedure, dubbed FABOLAS, which models loss and training time as a function of dataset size and automatically trades off high information gain about the global optimum against computational cost. Experiments optimizing support vector machines and deep neural networks show that FABOLAS often finds high-quality solutions 10 to 100 times faster than other state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods or the recently proposed bandit strategy Hyperband.},

abstract = {Obtaining validation data and comparison metrics for segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) are difficult tasks due to the lack of reliable ground truth. This problem is even more evident for images presenting pathology, which can both alter tissue appearance through infiltration and cause geometric distortions. Systems for generating synthetic images with user-defined degradation by noise and intensity inhomogeneity offer the possibility for testing and comparison of segmentation methods. Such systems do not yet offer simulation of sufficiently realistic looking pathology. This paper presents a system that combines physical and statistical modeling to generate synthetic multi-modal 3D brain MRI with tumor and edema, along with the underlying anatomical ground truth, Main emphasis is placed on simulation of the major effects known for tumor MRI, such as contrast enhancement, local distortion of healthy tissue, infiltrating edema adjacent to tumors, destruction and deformation of fiber tracts, and multi-modal MRI contrast of healthy tissue and pathology. The new method synthesizes pathology in multi-modal MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by simulating mass effect, warping and destruction of white matter fibers, and infiltration of brain tissues by tumor cells. We generate synthetic contrast enhanced MR images by simulating the accumulation of contrast agent within the brain. The appearance of the the brain tissue and tumor in MRI is simulated by synthesizing texture images from real MR images. The proposed method is able to generate synthetic ground truth and synthesized MR images with tumor and edema that exhibit comparable segmentation challenges to real tumor MRI. Such image data sets will find use in segmentation reliability studies, comparison and validation of different segmentation methods, training and teaching, or even in evaluating standards for tumor size like the RECIST criteria (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

New models based on deep learning have improved results but are restricted to pixel-wise fitting of the segmentation map. Our aim was to tackle this limitation by developing a new model based on deep learning which takes into account the area inside as well as outside the region of interest as well as the size of boundaries during learning. Specically, we propose a new loss function which incorporates area and size information and integrates this into a dense deep learning model. We evaluated our approach on a dataset of more than 2,000 cardiac MRI scans. Our results show that the proposed loss function outperforms other mainstream loss function Cross-entropy on two common segmentation networks. Our loss function is robust while using different hyperparameter lambda.},

abstract = {Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is used to treat patients with high-risk breast cancer. The tumor response to NAC can be classified as either a pathological partial response (pPR) or pathological complete response (pCR), defined as complete eradication of invasive tumor cells, with a pCR conferring a significantly lower risk of recurrence. Predicting the response to NAC, however, remains a significant clinical challenge. The objective of this study was to determine if analysis of nuclear features on core biopsies using artificial intelligence (AI) can predict response to NAC. Methods: Fifty-eight HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer patients were included in this study (pCR n = 37, pPR n = 21). Multiple deep convolutional neural networks were developed to automate tumor detection and nuclear segmentation. Nuclear count, area, and circularity, as well as image-based first- and second-order features including mean pixel intensity and correlation of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM-COR) were determined. Results: In univariate analysis, the pCR group had fewer multifocal/multicentric tumors, higher nuclear intensity, and lower GLCM-COR compared to the pPR group. In multivariate binary logistic regression, tumor multifocality/multicentricity (OR = 0.14, p = 0.012), nuclear intensity (OR = 1.23, p = 0.018), and GLCM-COR (OR = 0.96, p = 0.043) were each independently associated with likelihood of achieving a pCR, and the model was able to successful classify 79{\%} of cases (62{\%} for pPR and 89{\%} for pCR). Conclusion: Analysis of tumor nuclear features using digital pathology/AI can significantly improve models to predict pathological response to NAC.},

abstract = {Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) are widely employed image descriptors in modern computer-aided diagnosis systems. Built upon a set of local, robust statistics of low-level image gradients, HOG features are usually computed on raw intensity images. In this paper, we explore a learned image transformation scheme for producing higher-level inputs to HOG. Leveraging semantic object boundary cues, our methods compute data-driven image feature maps via a supervised boundary detector. Compared with the raw image map, boundary cues offer mid-level, more object-specific visual responses that can be suited for subsequent HOG encoding. We validate integrations of several image transformation maps with an application of computer-aided detection of lymph nodes on thoracoabdominal CT images. Our experiments demonstrate that semantic boundary cues based HOG descriptors complement and enrich the raw intensity alone. We observe an overall system with substantially improved results (∼ 78{\%} versus 60{\%} recall at 3 FP/volume for two target regions). The proposed system also moderately outperforms the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) system in the mediastinum region, without relying on data augmentation and requiring significantly fewer training samples.},

abstract = {Our ever-aging society faces the growing problem of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular dementia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides a unique tool for non-invasive investigation of these brain diseases. However, it is extremely difficult for neurologists to identify complex disease patterns from large amounts of three-dimensional images. In contrast, machine learning excels at automatic pattern recognition from large amounts of data. In particular, deep learning has achieved impressive results in image classification. Unfortunately, its application to medical image classification remains difficult. We consider two reasons for this difficulty: First, volumetric medical image data is considerably scarcer than natural images. Second, the complexity of 3D medical images is much higher compared to common 2D images. To address the problem of small data set size, we assemble the largest dataset ever used for training a deep 3D convolutional neural network to classify brain images as healthy (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers disease (AD). We use more than 20.000 images from subjects of these three classes, which is almost 9x the size of the previously largest data set. The problem of high dimensionality is addressed by using a deep 3D convolutional neural network, which is state-of-the-art in large-scale image classification. We exploit its ability to process the images directly, only with standard preprocessing, but without the need for elaborate feature engineering. Compared to other work, our workflow is considerably simpler, which increases clinical applicability. Accuracy is measured on the ADNI+AIBL data sets, and the independent CADDementia benchmark.},

The use of hierarchical data structures can ameliorate this problem by storing summary information to prevent useless exploration of regions of little or no current interest within the volume. This paper discusses research into the use of the octree hierarchical data structure when the regions of current interest can vary during the application, and are not known a priori. Octrees are well suited to the six-sided cell structure of many volumes. A new space-efficient design is introduced for octree representations of volumes whose resolutions are not conveniently a power of two; octrees following this design are called branch-on-need octrees 1992. Also, a caching method is described that essentially passes information between octree neighbors whose visitation times may be quite different, then discards it when its useful life is over. Using the application of octrees to isosurface generation as a focus, space and time comparisons for octree-based versus more traditional “marching” methods are presented. {\textcopyright} 1992, ACM.

abstract = {Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made progress in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification over the past few years. However, a crucial issue has not been addressed, i.e., the requirement of CNNs for abundant labeled samples versus the insufficient human annotations of PolSAR images. It is well known that following the supervised learning paradigm may lead to the overfitting of training data, and the lack of supervision information of PolSAR images undoubtedly aggravates this problem, which greatly affects the generalization performance of CNN-based classifiers in large-scale applications. To handle this problem, in this article, learning transferrable representations from unlabeled PolSAR data through convolutional architectures is explored for the first time. Specifically, a PolSAR-tailored contrastive learning network (PCLNet) is proposed for unsupervised deep PolSAR representation learning and few-shot classification. Different from the utilization of optical processing methods, a diversity stimulation mechanism is constructed to narrow the application gap between optics and PolSAR. Beyond the conventional supervised methods, PCLNet develops an unsupervised pretraining phase based on the proxy objective of instance discrimination to learn useful representations from unlabeled PolSAR data. The acquired representations are transferred to the downstream task, i.e., few-shot PolSAR classification. Experiments on two widely used PolSAR benchmark data sets confirm the validity of PCLNet. Besides, this work may enlighten how to efficiently utilize the massive unlabeled PolSAR data to alleviate the greedy demands of CNN-based methods for human annotations.},

abstract = {We introduce a fluid-based image augmentation method for medical image analysis. In contrast to existing methods, our framework generates anatomically meaningful images via interpolation from the geodesic subspace underlying given samples. Our approach consists of three steps: 1) given a source image and a set of target images, we construct a geodesic subspace using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model; 2) we sample transformations from the resulting geodesic subspace; 3) we obtain deformed images and segmentations via interpolation. Experiments on brain (LPBA) and knee (OAI) data illustrate the performance of our approach on two tasks: 1) data augmentation during training and testing for image segmentation; 2) one-shot learning for single atlas image segmentation. We demonstrate that our approach generates anatomically meaningful data and improves performance on these tasks over competing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/uncbiag/easyreg.},

abstract = {Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model's performance gain while annotating the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely accorded the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to the large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.) Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due. It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotations, while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DAL and provide some possible development directions.},

abstract = {The number of mitoses per tissue area gives an important aggressiveness indication of the invasive breast carcinoma. However, automatic mitosis detection in histology images remains a challenging problem. Traditional methods either employ hand-crafted features to discriminate mitoses from other cells or construct a pixel-wise classifier to label every pixel in a sliding window way. While the former suffers from the large shape variation of mitoses and the existence of many mimics with similar appearance, the slow speed of the later prohibits its use in clinical practice. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a fast and accurate method to detect mitosis by designing a novel deep cascaded convolutional neural network, which is composed of two components. First, by leveraging the fully convolutional neural network, we propose a coarse retrieval model to identify and locate the candidates of mitosis while preserving a high sensitivity. Based on these candidates, a fine discrimination model utilizing knowledge transferred from cross-domain is developed to further single out mitoses from hard mimics. Our approach outperformed other methods by a large margin in 2014 ICPR MITOS-ATYPIA challenge in terms of detection accuracy. When compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the 2012 ICPR MITOSIS data (a smaller and less challenging dataset), our method achieved comparable or better results with a roughly 60 times faster speed.},

Each case was annotated manually by an unprecedented number of seven different experts. Results of the challenge highlighted that automatic algorithms, including the recent machine learning methods (random forests, deep learning, {\ldots}), are still trailing human expertise on both detection and delineation criteria. In addition, we demonstrate that computing a statistically robust consensus of the algorithms performs closer to human expertise on one score (segmentation) although still trailing on detection scores.},

abstract = {The ability to extend the field of view of laparoscopy images can help the surgeons to obtain a better understanding of the anatomical context. However, due to tissue deformation, complex camera motion and significant three-dimensional (3D) anatomical surface, image pixels may have non-rigid deformation and traditional mosaicking methods cannot work robustly for laparoscopy images in real-time. To solve this problem, a novel two-dimensional (2D) non-rigid simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system is proposed in this paper, which is able to compensate for the deformation of pixels and perform image mosaicking in real-time. The key algorithm of this 2D non-rigid SLAM system is the expectation maximization and dual quaternion (EMDQ) algorithm, which can generate smooth and dense deformation field from sparse and noisy image feature matches in real-time. An uncertainty-based loop closing method has been proposed to reduce the accumulative errors. To achieve real-time performance, both CPU and GPU parallel computation technologies are used for dense mosaicking of all pixels. Experimental results on in vivo and synthetic data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our non-rigid mosaicking method.},

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how different CNN methods compare with each other and with previous state-of-the-art shallow representations such as the Bag-of-Visual-Words and the Improved Fisher Vector. This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost.

Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs.

Our solution is a single CNN with shared convolutional filters and domain-specific batch normalization layers, which can be tuned to new domains with only a few (≈ 4) labelled images.

Obtaining 3D segmentations of medical images for supervised training is difficult and labor intensive. Motivated by classical approaches for joint segmentation and registration we therefore propose a deep learning framework that jointly learns networks for image registration and image segmentation. In contrast to previous work on deep unsupervised image registration, which showed the benefit of weak supervision via image segmentations, our approach can use existing segmentations when available and computes them via the segmentation network otherwise, thereby providing the same registration benefit. Conversely, segmentation network training benefits from the registration, which essentially provides a realistic form of data augmentation. Experiments on knee and brain 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images show that our approach achieves large simultaneous improvements of segmentation and registration accuracy (over independently trained networks) and allows training high-quality models with very limited training data. Specifically, in a one-shot-scenario (with only one manually labeled image) our approach increases Dice scores ({\%}) over an unsupervised registration network by 2.7 and 1.8 on the knee and brain images respectively.},

We perform these simulations on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain.

abstract = {Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation of pulmonary airway, artery, and vein is challenging due to sparse supervisory signals caused by the severe class imbalance between tubular targets and background. We present a CNNs-based method for accurate airway and artery-vein segmentation in non-contrast computed tomography. It enjoys superior sensitivity to tenuous peripheral bronchioles, arterioles, and venules. The method first uses a feature recalibration module to make the best use of features learned from the neural networks. Spatial information of features is properly integrated to retain relative priority of activated regions, which benefits the subsequent channel-wise recalibration. Then, attention distillation module is introduced to reinforce representation learning of tubular objects. Fine-grained details in high-resolution attention maps are passing down from one layer to its previous layer recursively to enrich context. Anatomy prior of lung context map and distance transform map is designed and incorporated for better artery-vein differentiation capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrated considerable performance gains brought by these components. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method extracted much more branches while maintaining competitive overall segmentation performance.

abstract = {This work attempts to address two fundamental questions about the structure of the convolutional neural networks (CNN): (1) why a nonlinear activation function is essential at the filter output of all intermediate layers? (2) what is the advantage of the two-layer cascade system over the one-layer system? A mathematical model called the “REctified-COrrelations on a Sphere” (RECOS) is proposed to answer these two questions. After the CNN training process, the converged filter weights define a set of anchor vectors in the RECOS model. Anchor vectors represent the frequently occurring patterns (or the spectral components). The necessity of rectification is explained using the RECOS model. Then, the behavior of a two-layer RECOS system is analyzed and compared with its one-layer counterpart. The LeNet-5 and the MNIST dataset are used to illustrate discussion points. Finally, the RECOS model is generalized to a multilayer system with the AlexNet as an example.},

Results The longitudinal data in ADNI-2 provide natural history data on a clinical trials population and continue to inform refinement and standardization of assessments, models of trajectories, and clinical trial methods that have been extended into sporadic preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Discussion Plans for the next phase of the ADNI project include maintaining longitudinal follow-up of the normal and mild cognitive impairment cohorts, augmenting specific clinical cohorts, and incorporating novel computerized cognitive assessments and patient-reported outcomes. A major hypothesis is that AD represents a gradually progressive disease that can be identified precisely in its long presymptomatic phase, during which intervention with potentially disease-modifying agents may be most useful.},

To counter this limitation, there is active research ongoing in few shot learning. Few shot learning algorithms aim to overcome the data dependency by exploiting the information available from a very small amount of data. In medical imaging, due to the rare occurrence of some diseases, there is often a limitation on the available data, as a result, to which the success of few shot learning algorithms can prove to be a significant advancement. In this chapter, the background and working of few shot learning algorithms are explained. The problem statement for few shot classification and segmentation is described. There is then a detailed study of the problems faced in medical imaging related to the availability of limited data. After establishing context, the recent advances in the application of few shot learning to medical imaging tasks such as classification and segmentation are explored. The results of these applications are examined with a discussion on its future scope.},

In contrast, one might hope for machine learning systems that become more useful as they interact with people. In this work, we build and deploy a role-playing game, whereby human players converse with learning agents situated in an open-domain fantasy world. We show that by training models on the conversations they have with humans in the game the models progressively improve, as measured by automatic metrics and online engagement scores. This learning is shown to be more efficient than crowdsourced data when applied to conversations with real users, as well as being far cheaper to collect.},

It is pertinent that adaptations to new data distributions over time are tractable with automated analysis methods as medical imaging data acquisition is typically not a static problem. So, one needs to ensure that a continual learning paradigm be ensured in machine learning methods deployed for medical imaging. To explore interpretable lifelong learning for deep neural networks in medical imaging, we introduce a perspective of understanding forgetting in neural networks used in ultrasound image analysis through the notions of attention and saliency. Concretely, we propose quantification of forgetting as a decline in the quality of class specific saliency maps after each subsequent task schedule. We also introduce a knowledge transfer from past tasks to present by a saliency guided retention of past exemplars which improve the ability to retain past knowledge while optimizing parameters for current tasks. Experiments on a clinical fetal echocardiography dataset demonstrate a state-of-the-art performance for our protocols.},

abstract = {While tasks could come with varying number of instances in realistic settings, the existing meta-learning approaches for few-shot classfication assume even task distributions where the number of instances for each task and class are fixed. Due to such restriction, they learn to equally utilize the meta-knowledge across all the tasks, even when the number of instances per task and class largely varies. Moreover, they do not consider distributional difference in unseen tasks at the meta-test time, on which the meta-knowledge may have varying degree of usefulness depending on the task relatedness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel meta-learning model that adaptively balances the effect of the meta-learning and task-specific learning, and also class-specific learning within each task. Through the learning of the balancing variables, we can decide whether to obtain a solution close to the initial parameter or far from it. We formulate this objective into a Bayesian inference framework and solve it using variational inference. Our Bayesian Task-Adaptive Meta-Learning (Bayesian-TAML) significantly outperforms existing meta-learning approaches on benchmark datasets for both few-shot and realistic class- and task-imbalanced datasets, with especially higher gains on the latter.},

abstract = {Multi-organ segmentation is a challenging task due to the label imbalance and structural differences between different organs. In this work, we propose an efficient cascaded V-Net model to improve the performance of multi-organ segmentation by establishing dense Block Level Skip Connections (BLSC) across cascaded V-Net. Our model can take full advantage of features from the first stage network and make the cascaded structure more efficient. We also combine stacked small and large kernels with an inception-like structure to help our model to learn more patterns, which produces superior results for multi-organ segmentation. In addition, some small organs are commonly occluded by large organs and have unclear boundaries with other surrounding tissues, which makes them hard to be segmented. We therefore first locate the small organs through a multi-class network and crop them randomly with the surrounding region, then segment them with a single-class network. We evaluated our model on SegTHOR 2019 challenge unseen testing set and Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault challenge validation set. Our model has achieved an average dice score gain of 1.62 percents and 3.90 percents compared to traditional cascaded networks on these two datasets, respectively. For hard-to-segment small organs, such as the esophagus in SegTHOR 2019 challenge, our technique has achieved a gain of 5.63 percents on dice score, and four organs in Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault challenge have achieved a gain of 5.27 percents on average dice score.},

abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and nonresidual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08{\%} top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.},

This paper evaluates and compares 20 algorithms for recovering the local intra-voxel fiber structure from diffusion MRI data and is based on the results of the 'HARDI reconstruction challenge' organized in the context of the 'ISBI 2012' conference. Evaluated methods encompass a mixture of classical techniques well known in the literature such as diffusion tensor, Q-Ball and diffusion spectrum imaging, algorithms inspired by the recent theory of compressed sensing and also brand new approaches proposed for the first time at this contest. To quantitatively compare the methods under controlled conditions, two datasets with known ground-truth were synthetically generated and two main criteria were used to evaluate the quality of the reconstructions in every voxel: correct assessment of the number of fiber populations and angular accuracy in their orientation. This comparative study investigates the behavior of every algorithm with varying experimental conditions and highlights strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This information can be useful not only for enhancing current algorithms and develop the next generation of reconstruction methods, but also to assist physicians in the choice of the most adequate technique for their studies. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Task- and stimulus-based neuroimaging studies have begun to unveil the central autonomic network which modulates autonomic nervous system activity. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the central autonomic network without the bias constituted by the use of a task. Additionally, we assessed whether this circuitry presents signs of dysregulation in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition which may be associated with dysautonomia. We combined heart-rate-variability based methods for time-varying assessments of the autonomic nervous system outflow with resting-state fMRI in 14 healthy controls and 14 de novo PD patients, evaluating the correlations between fMRI time-series and the instantaneous high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum, a marker of parasympathetic outflow. In control subjects, the high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum was significantly anti-correlated with fMRI time-series in several cortical, subcortical and brainstem regions. This complex central network was not detectable in PD patients. In between-group analysis, we found that in healthy controls the brain activation related to the high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum was significantly less than in PD patients in the mid and anterior cingulum, sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area, insula and temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and in a region encompassing posterior cingulum, precuneus and parieto-occipital cortex. Our results indicate that the complex central network which modulates parasympathetic outflow in the resting state is impaired in the early clinical stages of PD.},

Although automatic and semi-automatic diagnoses of ROP based on fundus image have been researched, most of the previous studies focused on plus disease detection and ROP screening. There are few studies focusing on ROP staging, which is important for the severity evaluation of the disease. To be consistent with clinical 5-level ROP staging, a novel and effective deep neural network based 5-level ROP staging network is proposed, which consists of multi-stream based parallel feature extractor, concatenation based deep feature fuser and clinical practice based ordinal classifier. First, the three-stream parallel framework including ResNet18, DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB2 is proposed as the feature extractor, which can extract rich and diverse high-level features. Second, the features from three streams are deeply fused by concatenation and convolution to generate a more effective and comprehensive feature. Finally, in the classification stage, an ordinal classification strategy is adopted, which can effectively improve the ROP staging performance. The proposed ROP staging network was evaluated with per-image and per-examination strategies. For per-image ROP staging, the proposed method was evaluated on 635 retinal fundus images from 196 examinations, including 303 Normal, 26 Stage 1, 127 Stage 2, 106 Stage 3, 61 Stage 4 and 12 Stage 5, which achieves 0.9055 for weighted recall, 0.9092 for weighted precision, 0.9043 for weighted F1 score, 0.9827 for accuracy with 1 (ACC1) and 0.9786 for Kappa, respectively. While for per-examination ROP staging, 1173 examinations with a 4-fold cross validation strategy were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which prove the validity and advantage of the proposed method.},

Normal controls included chest CTs from oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false positive rate in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non COVID-19) pneumonias was 10{\%}.

abstract = {We revisit the idea of brain damage, i.e. the pruning of the coefficients of a neural network, and suggest how brain damage can be modified and used to speedup convolutional layers in ConvNets. The approach uses the fact that many efficient implementations reduce generalized convolutions to matrix multiplications. The suggested brain damage process prunes the convolutional kernel tensor in a group-wise fashion. After such pruning, convolutions can be reduced to multiplications of thinned dense matrices, which leads to speedup. We investigate different ways to add group-wise prunning to the learning process, and show that severalfold speedups of convolutional layers can be attained using group-sparsity regularizers. Our approach can adjust the shapes of the receptive fields in the convolutional layers, and even prune excessive feature maps from ConvNets, all in data-driven way.},

Any improvement in robust and accurate nodule characterization can assist in identifying cancer stage, prognosis, and improving treatment planning. In this study, we propose a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based nodule characterization strategy. With a completely 3D approach, we utilize the volumetric information from a CT scan which would be otherwise lost in the conventional 2D CNN based approaches. In order to address the need for a large amount of training data for CNN, we resort to transfer learning to obtain highly discriminative features.Moreover, we also acquire the task dependent feature representation for six high-level nodule attributes and fuse this complementary information via a Multi-task learning (MTL) framework. Finally, we propose to incorporate potential disagreement among radiologists while scoring different nodule attributes in a graph regularized sparsemulti-task learning. We evaluated our proposed approach on one of the largest publicly available lung nodule datasets comprising 1018 scans and obtained state-of-the-art results in regressing the malignancy scores.},

abstract = {Background Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum are part of the emotional neural circuitry implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). Music is often used for emotion regulation, and pleasurable music listening activates the dopaminergic system in the brain, including the ACC. The present study uses functional MRI (fMRI) and an emotional nonmusical and musical stimuli paradigm to examine how neural processing of emotionally provocative auditory stimuli is altered within the ACC and striatum in depression. Method Nineteen MDD and 20 never-depressed (ND) control participants listened to standardized positive and negative emotional musical and nonmusical stimuli during fMRI scanning and gave subjective ratings of valence and arousal following scanning. Results ND participants exhibited greater activation to positive versus negative stimuli in ventral ACC. When compared with ND participants, MDD participants showed a different pattern of activation in ACC. In the rostral part of the ACC, ND participants showed greater activation for positive information, while MDD participants showed greater activation to negative information. In dorsal ACC, the pattern of activation distinguished between the types of stimuli, with ND participants showing greater activation to music compared to nonmusical stimuli, while MDD participants showed greater activation to nonmusical stimuli, with the greatest response to negative nonmusical stimuli. No group differences were found in striatum. Conclusions These results suggest that people with depression may process emotional auditory stimuli differently based on both the type of stimulation and the emotional content of that stimulation. This raises the possibility that music may be useful in retraining ACC function, potentially leading to more effective and targeted treatments.},

In this paper,we present a novel 3D deeply supervised network (3D DSN) to address this challenging task. The proposed 3D DSN takes advantage of a fully convolutional architecture which performs efficient end-to-end learning and inference. More importantly,we introduce a deep supervision mechanism during the learning process to combat potential optimization difficulties,and thus the model can acquire a much faster convergence rate and more powerful discrimination capability. On top of the high-quality score map produced by the 3D DSN,a conditional random field model is further employed to obtain refined segmentation results. We evaluated our framework on the public MICCAI-SLiver07 dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method achieves competitive segmentation results to state-of-the-art approaches with a much faster processing speed.},

abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5{\%} (7.7{\%} point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

However, most usable network architectures are hand-crafted and usually require expertise and elaborate design. In this paper, we provide a block-wise network generation pipeline called BlockQNN which automatically builds high-performance networks using the Q-Learning paradigm with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. The optimal network block is constructed by the learning agent which is trained sequentially to choose component layers. We stack the block to construct the whole auto-generated network. To accelerate the generation process, we also propose a distributed asynchronous framework and an early stop strategy. The block-wise generation brings unique advantages: (1) it performs competitive results in comparison to the hand-crafted state-of-the-art networks on image classification, additionally, the best network generated by BlockQNN achieves 3.54{\%} top-1 error rate on CIFAR-10 which beats all existing auto-generate networks. (2) in the meanwhile, it offers tremendous reduction of the search space in designing networks which only spends 3 days with 32 GPUs, and (3) moreover, it has strong generalizability that the network built on CIFAR also performs well on a larger-scale ImageNet dataset.},

abstract = {Human vision is able to immediately recognize novel visual categories after seeing just one or a few training examples. We describe how to add a similar capability to ConvNet classifiers by directly setting the final layer weights from novel training examples during low-shot learning. We call this process weight imprinting as it directly sets weights for a new category based on an appropriately scaled copy of the embedding layer activations for that training example. The imprinting process provides a valuable complement to training with stochastic gradient descent, as it provides immediate good classification performance and an initialization for any further fine-tuning in the future. We show how this imprinting process is related to proxy-based embeddings. However, it differs in that only a single imprinted weight vector is learned for each novel category, rather than relying on a nearest-neighbor distance to training instances as typically used with embedding methods. Our experiments show that using averaging of imprinted weights provides better generalization than using nearest-neighbor instance embeddings.},

Then, we present a publicly available database of lung CT imaging signs, called LISS for short, which contains 271 CT scans and 677 abnormal regions in them. The 677 abnormal regions are divided into nine categories of common CT imaging signs of lung disease (CISLs). The ground truth of these CISLs regions and the corresponding categories are provided. Furthermore, to make the database publicly available, all private data in CT scans are eliminated or replaced with provisioned values. The main characteristic of our LISS database is that it is developed from a new perspective of CT imaging signs of lung diseases instead of commonly considered lung nodules. Thus, it is promising to apply to computer-aided detection and diagnosis research and medical education.},

abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the beginning of 2004 medical spiral-CT scanners that acquire up to 64 slices simultaneously became available. Most manufacturers use a straightforward acquisition principle, namely an x-ray focus rotating on a circular path and an opposing cylindrical detector whose rotational center coincides with the x-ray focus. The 64-slice scanner available to us, a Somatom Sensation 64 spiral cone-beam CT scanner (Siemens, Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany), makes use of a flying focal spot (FFS) that allows for view-by-view deflections of the focal spot in the rotation direction (aFFS) and in the z-direction (zFFS) with the goal of reducing aliasing artifacts. The FFS feature doubles the sampling density in the radial direction (channel direction, aFFS) and in the longitudinal direction (detector row direction or z-direction, zFFS). The cost of increased radial and azimuthal sampling is a two- or four-fold reduction of azimuthal sampling (angular sampling). To compensate for the potential reduction of azimuthal sampling the scanner simply increases the number of detector read-outs (readings) per rotation by a factor two or four. Then, up to four detector readings contribute to what we define as one view or one projection. A significant reduction of in-plane aliasing and of aliasing in the z -direction can be expected. Especially the latter is of importance to spiral CT scans where aliasing is known to produce so-called windmill artifacts. We have derived and analyzed the optimal focal spot deflection values da and dz as they would ideally occur in our scanner. Based upon these we show how image reconstruction can be performed in general. A simulation study showing reconstructions of mathematical phantoms further provides evidence that image quality can be significantly improved with the FFS. Aliasing artifacts, that manifest as streaks emerging from high-contrast objects, and windmill artifacts are reduced by almost an order of magnitude with the FFS compared to a simulation without FFS. Patient images acquired with our 64-slice cone-beam CT scanner support these results. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose: The development of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods for lung nodule detection, classification, and quantitative assessment can be facilitated through a well-characterized repository of computed tomography (CT) scans. The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI) completed such a database, establishing a publicly available reference for the medical imaging research community. Initiated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), further advanced by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), and accompanied by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through active participation, this public-private partnership demonstrates the success of a consortium founded on a consensus-based process. Methods: Seven academic centers and eight medical imaging companies collaborated to identify, address, and resolve challenging organizational, technical, and clinical issues to provide a solid foundation for a robust database. The LIDC/IDRI Database contains 1018 cases, each of which includes images from a clinical thoracic CT scan and an associated XML file that records the results of a two-phase image annotation process performed by four experienced thoracic radiologists. In the initial blinded-read phase, each radiologist independently reviewed each CT scan and marked lesions belonging to one of three categories (" nodule≥3 mm," " nodule{\textless}3 mm," and "non- nodule≥3 mm "). In the subsequent unblinded-read phase, each radiologist independently reviewed their own marks along with the anonymized marks of the three other radiologists to render a final opinion. The goal of this process was to identify as completely as possible all lung nodules in each CT scan without requiring forced consensus. Results: The Database contains 7371 lesions marked "nodule" by at least one radiologist. 2669 of these lesions were marked " nodul≥3 mm " by at least one radiologist, of which 928 (34.7{\%}) received such marks from all four radiologists. These 2669 lesions include nodule outlines and subjective nodule characteristic ratings. Conclusions: The LIDC/IDRI Database is expected to provide an essential medical imaging research resource to spur CAD development, validation, and dissemination in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2011 U.S. Government.},

abstract = {Scene understanding is an important yet very challenging problem in computer vision. In the past few years, researchers have taken advantage of the recent diffusion of depth-RGB (RGB-D) cameras to help simplify the problem of inferring scene semantics. However, while the added 3D geometry is certainly useful to segment out objects with different depth values, it also adds complications in that the 3D geometry is often incorrect because of noisy depth measurements and the actual 3D extent of the objects is usually unknown because of occlusions. In this paper we propose a new method that allows us to jointly refine the 3D reconstruction of the scene (raw depth values) while accurately segmenting out the objects or scene elements from the 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by introducing a new model which we called Voxel-CRF. The Voxel-CRF model is based on the idea of constructing a conditional random field over a 3D volume of interest which captures the semantic and 3D geometric relationships among different elements (voxels) of the scene. Such model allows to jointly estimate (1) a dense voxel-based 3D reconstruction and (2) the semantic labels associated with each voxel even in presence of partial occlusions using an approximate yet efficient inference strategy. We evaluated our method on the challenging NYU Depth dataset (Version 1 and 2). Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy in inferring scene semantics and visually appealing results in improving the quality of the 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate an interesting application of object removal and scene completion from RGB-D images. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent attempts at Super-Resolution for medical images used deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve perceptually realistic single image Super-Resolution. Yet, they are constrained by their inability to generalise to different scale factors. This involves high storage and energy costs as every integer scale factor involves a separate neural network. A recent paper has proposed a novel meta-learning technique that uses a Weight Prediction Network to enable Super-Resolution on arbitrary scale factors using only a single neural network. In this paper, we propose a new network that combines that technique with SRGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN-based architecture, to achieve arbitrary scale, high fidelity Super-Resolution for medical images. By using this network to perform arbitrary scale magnifications on images from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset, we demonstrate that it is able to outperform traditional interpolation methods by up to 20{\%} on SSIM scores whilst retaining generalisability on brain MRI images. We show that performance across scales is not compromised, and that it is able to achieve competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods such as EDSR whilst being fifty times smaller than them. Combining efficiency, performance, and generalisability, this can hopefully become a new foundation for tackling Super-Resolution on medical images.},

abstract = {Data annotation is a fundamental precursor for establishing large training sets to effectively apply deep learning methods to medical image analysis. For cell segmentation, obtaining high quality annotations is an expensive process that usually requires manual grading by experts. This work introduces an approach to efficiently generate annotated images, called {\&}{\#}x201C;A-GANs{\&}{\#}x201D;, created by combining an active cell appearance model (ACAM) with conditional generative adversarial networks (C-GANs). ACAM is a statistical model that captures a realistic range of cell characteristics and is used to ensure that the image statistics of generated cells are guided by real data. C-GANs utilize cell contours generated by ACAM to produce cells that match input contours. By pairing ACAM-generated contours with A-GANs-based generated images, high quality annotated images can be efficiently generated. Experimental results on adaptive optics (AO) retinal images showed that A-GANs robustly synthesizes realistic, artificial images whose cell distributions are exquisitely specified by ACAM. The cell segmentation performance using as few as 64 manually-annotated real AO images combined with 248 artificially-generated images from A-GANs were similar to the case of using 248 manually-annotated real images alone (Dice coefficients of 88{\%} for both). Finally, application to rare diseases in which images exhibit never-seen characteristics demonstrated improvements in cell segmentation without the need for incorporating manual annotations from these new retinal images. Overall, A-GANs introduce a methodology for generating high quality annotated data that statistically captures the characteristics of any desired dataset and can be used to more efficiently train deep-learning-based medical image analysis applications.},

abstract = {S pine CT is a commonly performed imaging procedure. In this study, we focused on labeling the vertebrae , which is the task of both locating and identifying the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae in a regular spine CT scan. Labeling the vertebrae has immediate diagnostic consequences. Vertebral landmarks help identify scoliosis, pathologic lordosis, and kyphosis, for example. From a modeling perspective, labeling simplifies the downstream tasks of intervertebral disk segmenta-tion and vertebral segmentation. Previous approaches to labeling fell into one of two broad categories: the traditional model-based approaches and the relatively recent learning-based approaches. Model-based approaches such as those of Schmidt et al (1), Klinder et al (2), and Ma and Lu (3) used a priori information on the spine structure, such as statistical shape models or atlases. Due to their extensive reliance on a priori information, the generalizability of these approaches was limited. From a machine learning perspective, approaches have existed, ranging from regression forest models working on context features in Glocker et al (4), Glocker et al (5), and Suzani et al (6); a combination of convolutional neural networks and random forest models in Chen et al (7); and three-dimensional (3D) fully convolutional networks in Yang et al (8), followed by recurrent neural networks in Yang et al (9) and Liao et al (10). Most of these approaches work on full 3D multidetector CT scans. Recently , an approach achieved a higher labeling performance by working on two-dimensional (2D) maximum intensity projections (MIPs) using an architecture termed Btrfly Net, which was first proposed by Sekuboyina et al (11). In this study, we improved on the Btrfly architecture and extended it with a spine localization module, thus making the combination more generalizable. Concurrently , inspired by the generative adversarial learning domain , we investigated an a priori learning module that enforced the spine's anatomic a priori knowledge (ie, prior) onto the Btrfly network. Earlier approaches were This copy is for personal use only. To order printed copies, contact reprints@rsna.org Purpose: To use and test a labeling algorithm that operates on two-dimensional reformations, rather than three-dimensional data to locate and identify vertebrae. Materials and Methods: The authors improved the Btrfly Net, a fully convolutional network architecture described by Sekuboyina et al, which works on sagittal and coronal maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and augmented it with two additional components: spine localization and adversarial a priori learning. Furthermore, two variants of adversarial training schemes that incorporated the anatomic a priori knowledge into the Btrfly Net were explored. The superiority of the proposed approach for labeling vertebrae on three data-sets was investigated: a public benchmarking dataset of 302 CT scans and two in-house datasets with a total of 238 CT scans. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed to compute the statistical significance of the improvement in performance observed with various architectural components in the authors' approach. Results: On the public dataset, the authors' approach using the described Btrfly Net with energy-based prior encoding (Btrfly pe-eb) network performed as well as current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a statistically significant (P , .001) vertebrae identification rate of 88.5{\%} 6 0.2 (standard deviation) and localization distances of less than 7 mm. On the in-house datasets that had a higher interscan data variability, an identification rate of 85.1{\%} 6 1.2 was obtained. Conclusion: An identification performance comparable to existing three-dimensional approaches was achieved when labeling vertebrae on two-dimensional MIPs. The performance was further improved using the proposed adversarial training regimen that effectively enforced local spine a priori knowledge during training. Spine localization increased the generalizability of our approach by homogeniz-ing the content in the MIPs.},

However, recent observations encourage a fundamentally different view. Imaging studies demonstrate that negative affect, pain and cognitive control activate an overlapping region of the dorsal cingulate - the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC). Anatomical studies reveal that the aMCC constitutes a hub where information about reinforcers can be linked to motor centres responsible for expressing affect and executing goal-directed behaviour. Computational modelling and other kinds of evidence suggest that this intimacy reflects control processes that are common to all three domains. These observations compel a reconsideration of the dorsal cingulate's contribution to negative affect and pain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy is becoming a more prevalent disease in diabetic patients nowadays. The surprising fact about the disease is it leaves no symptoms at the beginning stage and the patient can realize the disease only when his vision starts to fall. If the disease is not found at the earliest it leads to a stage where the probability of curing the disease is less. But if we find the disease at that stage, the patient might be in a situation of losing the vision completely. Hence, this paper aims at finding the disease at the earliest possible stage by extracting two features from the retinal image namely Microaneurysms which is found to be the starting symptom showing feature and Hemorrhage which shows symptoms of the other stages. Based on these two features we classify the stage of the disease as normal, beginning, mild and severe using convolutional neural network, a deep learning technique which reduces the burden of manual feature extraction and gives higher accuracy. We also locate the position of these features in the disease affected retinal images to help the doctors offer better medical treatment.},

abstract = {This paper reviews recent studies in understanding neural-network representations and learning neural networks with interpretable/disentangled middle-layer representations. Although deep neural networks have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, interpretability is always Achilles' heel of deep neural networks. At present, deep neural networks obtain high discrimination power at the cost of a low interpretability of their black-box representations. We believe that high model interpretability may help people break several bottlenecks of deep learning, e.g., learning from a few annotations, learning via human–computer communications at the semantic level, and semantically debugging network representations. We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability. Finally, we discuss prospective trends in explainable artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the modality of choice for investigating in-vivo white matter connectivity and neural tissue architecture of the brain. The diffusion-weighted signal in dMRI reflects the diffusivity of water molecules in brain tissue and can be utilized to produce image-based biomarkers for clinical research. Due to the constraints on scanning time, a limited number of measurements can be acquired within a clinically feasible scan time. In order to reconstruct the dMRI signal from a discrete set of measurements, a large number of algorithms have been proposed in recent years in conjunction with varying sampling schemes, i.e., with varying b-values and gradient directions. Thus, it is imperative to compare the performance of these reconstruction methods on a single data set to provide appropriate guidelines to neuroscientists on making an informed decision while designing their acquisition protocols. For this purpose, the SPArse Reconstruction Challenge (SPARC) was held along with the workshop on Computational Diffusion MRI (at MICCAI 2014) to validate the performance of multiple reconstruction methods using data acquired from a physical phantom. A total of 16 reconstruction algorithms (9 teams) participated in this community challenge. The goal was to reconstruct single b-value and/or multiple b-value data from a sparse set of measurements. In particular, the aim was to determine an appropriate acquisition protocol (in terms of the number of measurements, b-values) and the analysis method to use for a neuroimaging study. The challenge did not delve on the accuracy of these methods in estimating model specific measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) or mean diffusivity, but on the accuracy of these methods to fit the data. This paper presents several quantitative results pertaining to each reconstruction algorithm. The conclusions in this paper provide a valuable guideline for choosing a suitable algorithm and the corresponding data-sampling scheme for clinical neuroscience applications.},

Leveraging the recent success of adversarial learning for semi-supervised segmentation, we propose a novel method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to train a segmentation model with both labeled and unlabeled images. The proposed method prevents over-fitting by learning to discriminate between true and fake patches obtained by a generator network. Our work extends current adversarial learning approaches, which focus on 2D single-modality images, to the more challenging context of 3D volumes of multiple modalities. The proposed method is evaluated on the problem of segmenting brain MRI from the iSEG-2017 and MRBrainS 2013 datasets. Significant performance improvement is reported, compared to state-of-Art segmentation networks trained in a fully-supervised manner. In addition, our work presents a comprehensive analysis of different GAN architectures for semi-supervised segmentation, showing recent techniques like feature matching to yield a higher performance than conventional adversarial training approaches.

abstract = {Accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules using ultrasonography is a valuable but tough task even for experienced radiologists, considering both benign and malignant nodules have heterogeneous appearances. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods could potentially provide objective suggestions to assist radiologists. However, the performance of existing learning-based approaches is still limited, for direct application of general learning models often ignores critical domain knowledge related to the specific nodule diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel deep-learning-based CAD system, guided by task-specific prior knowledge, for automated nodule detection and classification in ultrasound images. Our proposed CAD system consists of two stages. First, a multi-scale region-based detection network is designed to learn pyramidal features for detecting nodules at different feature scales. The region proposals are constrained by the prior knowledge about size and shape distributions of real nodules. Then, a multi-branch classification network is proposed to integrate multi-view diagnosis-oriented features, in which each network branch captures and enhances one specific group of characteristics that were generally used by radiologists. We evaluated and compared our method with the state-of-the-art CAD methods and experienced radiologists on two datasets, i.e. Dataset I and Dataset II. The detection and diagnostic accuracy on Dataset I were 97.5{\%} and 97.1{\%}, respectively. Besides, our CAD system also achieved better performance than experienced radiologists on Dataset II, with improvements of accuracy for 8{\%}. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is effective in the discrimination of thyroid nodules.},

abstract = {Purpose: With the aging population and the global diabetes epidemic, the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) diseases which are the leading causes of blindness is further increasing. Intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications are the standard of care for their indications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), as a noninvasive imaging modality, plays a major part in guiding the administration of anti-VEGF therapy by providing detailed cross-sectional scans of the retina pathology. Fully automating OCT image detection can significantly decrease the tedious clinician labor and obtain a faithful pre-diagnosis from the analysis of the structural elements of the retina. Thereby, we explore the use of deep transfer learning method based on the visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) network for classifying AMD and DME in OCT images accurately and automatically. Method: A total of 207,130 retinal OCT images between 2013 and 2017 were selected from retrospective cohorts of 5319 adult patients from the Shiley Eye Institute of the University of California San Diego, the California Retinal Research Foundation, Medical Center Ophthalmology Associates, the Shanghai First People's Hospital, and the Beijing Tongren Eye Center, with 109,312 images (37,456 with choroidal neovascularization, 11,599 with diabetic macular edema, 8867 with drusen, and 51,390 normal) for the experiment. After images preprocessing, 1000 images (250 images from each category) from 633 patients were selected as validation dataset while the rest images from another 4686 patients were used as training dataset. We used deep transfer learning method to fine-tune the VGG-16 network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and evaluated its performance on the validation dataset. Then, prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) were calculated. Results: Experimental results proved that the proposed approach had manifested superior performance in retinal OCT images detection, which achieved a prediction accuracy of 98.6{\%}, with a sensitivity of 97.8{\%}, a specificity of 99.4{\%}, and introduced an area under the ROC curve of 100{\%}. Conclusion: Deep transfer learning method based on the VGG-16 network shows significant effectiveness on classification of retinal OCT images with a relatively small dataset, which can provide assistant support for medical decision-making. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is comparable to that of human experts with significant clinical experience. Thereby, it will find promising applications in an automatic diagnosis and classification of common retinal diseases.},

abstract = {We present an accurate, fast and efficient method for segmentation and muscle mask propagation in 3D freehand ultrasound data, towards accurate volume quantification. A deep Siamese 3D Encoder-Decoder network that captures the evolution of the muscle appearance and shape for contiguous slices is deployed. We use it to propagate a reference mask annotated by a clinical expert. To handle longer changes of the muscle shape over the entire volume and to provide an accurate propagation, we devise a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory module. Also, to train our model with a minimal amount of training samples, we propose a strategy combining learning from few annotated 2D ultrasound slices with sequential pseudo-labelling of the unannotated slices. We introduce a decremental update of the objective function to guide the model convergence in the absence of large amounts of annotated data. After training with a few volumes, the decremental update strategy switches from a weak supervised training to a few-shot setting. Finally, to handle the class-imbalance between foreground and background muscle pixels, we propose a parametric Tversky loss function that learns to penalize adaptively the false positives and the false negatives. We validate our approach for the segmentation, label propagation, and volume computation of the three low-limb muscles on a dataset of 61600 images from 44 subjects.

abstract = {Purpose: Automated delineation of structures and organs is a key step in medical imaging. However, due to the large number and diversity of structures and the large variety of segmentation algorithms, a consensus is lacking as to which automated segmentation method works best for certain applications. Segmentation challenges are a good approach for unbiased evaluation and comparison of segmentation algorithms. Methods: In this work, we describe and present the results of the Head and Neck Auto-Segmentation Challenge 2015, a satellite event at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2015 conference. Six teams participated in a challenge to segment nine structures in the head and neck region of CT images: brainstem, mandible, chiasm, bilateral optic nerves, bilateral parotid glands, and bilateral submandibular glands. Results: This paper presents the quantitative results of this challenge using multiple established error metrics and a well-defined ranking system. The strengths and weaknesses of the different auto-segmentation approaches are analyzed and discussed. Conclusions: The Head and Neck Auto-Segmentation Challenge 2015 was a good opportunity to assess the current state-of-the-art in segmentation of organs at risk for radiotherapy treatment. Participating teams had the possibility to compare their approaches to other methods under unbiased and standardized circumstances. The results demonstrate a clear tendency toward more general purpose and fewer structure-specific segmentation algorithms.},

abstract = {Developing nations lack adequate number of hospitals with modern equipment and skilled doctors. Hence, a significant proportion of these nations' population, particularly in rural areas, is not able to avail specialized and timely healthcare facilities. In recent years, deep learning (DL) models, a class of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, have shown impressive results in medical domain. These AI methods can provide immense support to developing nations as affordable healthcare solutions. This work is focused on one such application of blood cancer diagnosis. However, there are some challenges to DL models in cancer research because of the unavailability of a large data for adequate training and the difficulty of capturing heterogeneity in data at different levels ranging from acquisition characteristics, session, to subject-level (within subjects and across subjects). These challenges render DL models prone to overfitting and hence, models lack generalization on prospective subjects' data. In this work, we address these problems in the application of B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) diagnosis using deep learning. We propose heterogeneity loss that captures subject-level heterogeneity, thereby, forcing the neural network to learn subject-independent features. We also propose an unorthodox ensemble strategy that helps us in providing improved classification over models trained on 7-folds giving a weighted-F1 score of 95.26{\%} on unseen (test) subjects' data that are, so far, the best results on the C-NMC 2019 dataset for B-ALL classification.},

We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 (“Human Against Machine with 10000 training images”) dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions.

The proton density weighted image was acquired prior to the DCE time series using the same sequence with different echo and repetition times and a different flip angle. Finally, the DWI series were acquired with a single-shot echo planar imaging sequence with a resolution of 2 mm in-plane and 3.6 mm slice thickness and with diffusion-encoding gradients in three directions. Three b-values were acquired (50, 400, and 800), and subsequently, the ADC map was calculated by the scanner software. All images were acquired without an endorectal coil.},

However, such large labeled datasets are costly to acquire. Active learning techniques can be used to minimize the number of required training labels while maximizing the model's performance. In this work, we propose a novel sampling method that queries the unlabeled examples that maximize the average distance to all training set examples in a learned feature space. We then extend our sampling method to define a better initial training set, without the need for a trained model, by using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature descriptors. We validate MedAL on 3 medical image datasets and show that our method is robust to different dataset properties. MedAL is also efficient, achieving 80{\%} accuracy on the task of Diabetic Retinopathy detection using only 425 labeled images, corresponding to a 32{\%} reduction in the number of required labeled examples compared to the standard uncertainty sampling technique, and a 40{\%} reduction compared to random sampling.},

abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos ( n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ldquoImageNetrdquo, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

We design two new feature descriptors for higher feature descriptiveness, namely the rotation-invariant Gabor-local binary patterns (RGLBP) texture descriptor and multi-coordinate histogram of oriented gradients (MCHOG) gradient descriptor. Together with intensity features, each image patch is then labeled based on its feature approximation from reference image patches. And a new patch-adaptive sparse approximation (PASA) method is designed with the following main components: minimum discrepancy criteria for sparse-based classification, patch-specific adaptation for discriminative approximation, and feature-space weighting for distance computation. The patch-wise labelings are then accumulated as probabilistic estimations for region-level classification. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available ILD database, showing encouraging performance improvements over the state-of-the-arts. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Yet, capturing the geometry or complete shapes of everyday objects using scanning devices (e.g. Kinect) still comes with several challenges that result in noise or even incomplete shapes. Recent success in deep learning has shown how to learn complex shape distributions in a data-driven way from large scale 3D CAD Model collections and to utilize them for 3D processing on volumetric representations and thereby circumventing problems of topology and tessellation. Prior work has shown encouraging results on problems ranging from shape completion to recognition.We provide an analysis of such approaches and discover that training as well as the resulting representation are strongly and unnecessarily tied to the notion of object labels. Thus, we propose a full convolutional volumetric auto encoder that learns volumetric representation from noisy data by estimating the voxel occupancy grids. The proposed method outperforms prior work on challenging tasks like denoising and shape completion. We also show that the obtained deep embedding gives competitive performance when used for classification and promising results for shape interpolation.},

During training, this loss function is optimised together with the conventional average per-voxel cross entropy loss.

The discriminative model is a deep network consisting of convolutional, fully connected and dropout layers. The kinematic constraints are incorporated as a kinematic layer towards the end of the network, which acts as a prior for the hand pose.

Taken together, the chapters cover the entire software lifecycle: from problem diagnosis to project (or action) planning and execution, to documenting and disseminating results, including validity assessments for AR studies.The goal of this book is to help everyone interested in industry-academia collaborations to conduct joint research. It is for students of software engineering who need to learn about how to set up an evaluation, how to run a project, and how to document the results. It is for all academics who aren't afraid to step out of their comfort zone and enter industry. It is for industrial researchers who know that they want to do more than just develop software blindly. And finally, it is for stakeholders who want to learn how to manage industrial research projects and how to set up guidelines for their own role and expectations.},

abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

abstract = {Few-shot learning methods aim for good performance in the low-data regime. Structured output tasks such as segmentation present difficulties for few-shot learning because of their high dimensionality and the statistical dependencies among outputs. To tackle this problem, we propose the co-FCN, a conditional network learned by end-to-end optimization to perform fast, accurate few-shot segmentation. The network conditions on an annotated support set of images via feature fusion to do inference on an unannotated query image. Once learned, our conditioning approach requires no further optimization for new data. Annotations are instead conditioned on in a single forward pass, making our method suitable for interactive use. We evaluate our co-FCN with dense and sparse annotations, and it achieves competitive accuracy even when given only one positive pixel and one negative pixel, reducing the annotation burden for segmenting new concepts.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a simple, highly efficient and modularized Dual Path Network (DPN) for image classification which presents a new topology of connection paths internally. By revealing the equivalence of the state-of-the-art Residual Network (ResNet) and Densely Convolutional Network (DenseNet) within the HORNN framework, we find that ResNet enables feature re-usage while DenseNet enables new features exploration which are both important for learning good representations. To enjoy the benefits from both path topologies, our proposed Dual Path Network shares common features while maintaining the flexibility to explore new features through dual path architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, ImagNet-1k, Places365 and PASCAL VOC, clearly demonstrate superior performance of the proposed DPN over state-of-the-arts. In particular, on the ImagNet-1k dataset, a shallow DPN surpasses the best ResNeXt-101(64 × 4d) with 26{\%} smaller model size, 25{\%} less computational cost and 8{\%} lower memory consumption, and a deeper DPN (DPN-131) further pushes the state-of-the-art single model performance with about 2 times faster training speed. Experiments on the Places365 large-scale scene dataset, PASCAL VOC detection dataset, and PASCAL VOC segmentation dataset also demonstrate its consistently better performance than DenseNet, ResNet and the latest ResNeXt model over various applications.},

abstract = {Cell nuclei detection and fine-grained classification have been fundamental yet challenging problems in histopathology image analysis. Due to the nuclei tiny size, significant inter/intra-class variances, as well as the inferior image quality, previous automated methods would easily suffer from limited accuracy and robustness. In the meanwhile, existing approaches usually deal with these two tasks independently, which would neglect the close relatedness of them. In this paper, we present a novel method of sibling fully convolutional network with prior objectness interaction (called SFCN-OPI) to tackle the two tasks simultaneously and interactively using a unified end-to-end framework. Specifically, the sibling FCN branches share features in earlier layers while holding respective higher layers for specific tasks. More importantly, the detection branch outputs the objectness prior which dynamically interacts with the fine-grained classification sibling branch during the training and testing processes. With this mechanism, the fine-grained classification successfully focuses on regions with high confidence of nuclei existence and outputs the conditional probability, which in turn benefits the detection through back propagation. Extensive experiments on colon cancer histology images have validated the effectiveness of our proposed SFCN-OPI and our method has outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

In recent years, a number of video datasets intended for background subtraction have been created to address the problem of large realistic datasets with accurate ground truth. The use of these datasets enables qualitative as well as quantitative comparisons and allows benchmarking of different algorithms. Finding the appropriate dataset is generally a cumbersome task for an exhaustive evaluation of algorithms. Therefore, we systematically survey standard video datasets and list their applicability for different applications.

The video datasets are presented in chronological order of their appearance. Current trends of deep learning in background subtraction along with top-ranked background subtraction methods are also discussed in this paper.

Yet, pancreas is a challenging abdominal organ to segment due to the high inter-patient anatomical variability in both shape and volume metrics. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated promising performance on accurate segmentation of pancreas. However, the CNN-based method often suffers from segmentation discontinuity for reasons such as noisy image quality and blurry pancreatic boundary. In this chapter, we first discuss the CNN configurations and training objectives that lead to the state-of-the-art performance on pancreas segmentation. We then present a recurrent neural network (RNN) to address the problem of segmentation spatial inconsistency across adjacent image slices. The RNN takes outputs of the CNN and refines the segmentation by improving the shape smoothness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic (CT) colonography is a noninvasive option in screening for colorectal cancer. However, its accuracy as a screening tool in asymptomatic adults has not been well defined. METHODS: We recruited 2600 asymptomatic study participants, 50 years of age or older, at 15 study centers. CT colonographic images were acquired with the use of standard bowel preparation, stool and fluid tagging, mechanical insufflation, and multidetector-row CT scanners (with 16 or more rows). Radiologists trained in CT colonography reported all lesions measuring 5 mm or more in diameter. Optical colonoscopy and histologic review were performed according to established clinical protocols at each center and served as the reference standard. The primary end point was detection by CT colonography of histologically confirmed large adenomas and adenocarcinomas (10 mm in diameter or larger) that had been detected by colonoscopy; detection of smaller colorectal lesions (6 to 9 mm in diameter) was also evaluated. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 2531 participants (97{\%}). For large adenomas and cancers, the mean (±SE) per-patient estimates of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for CT colonography were 0.90±0.03, 0.86±0.02, 0.23±0.02, 0.99±{\textless}0.01, and 0.89±0.02, respectively. The sensitivity of 0.90 (i.e., 90{\%}) indicates that CT colonography failed to detect a lesion measuring 10 mm or more in diameter in 10{\%} of patients. The per-polyp sensitivity for large adenomas or cancers was 0.84±0.04. The per-patient sensitivity for detecting adenomas that were 6 mm or more in diameter was 0.78. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of asymptomatic adults, CT colonographic screening identified 90{\%} of subjects with adenomas or cancers measuring 10 mm or more in diameter. These findings augment published data on the role of CT colonography in screening patients with an average risk of colorectal cancer.

abstract = {Surgical tool detection is attracting increasing attention from the medical image analysis community. The goal generally is not to precisely locate tools in images, but rather to indicate which tools are being used by the surgeon at each instant. The main motivation for annotating tool usage is to design efficient solutions for surgical workflow analysis, with potential applications in report generation, surgical training and even real-time decision support. Most existing tool annotation algorithms focus on laparoscopic surgeries. However, with 19 million interventions per year, the most common surgical procedure in the world is cataract surgery. The CATARACTS challenge was organized in 2017 to evaluate tool annotation algorithms in the specific context of cataract surgery. It relies on more than nine hours of videos, from 50 cataract surgeries, in which the presence of 21 surgical tools was manually annotated by two experts. With 14 participating teams, this challenge can be considered a success. As might be expected, the submitted solutions are based on deep learning. This paper thoroughly evaluates these solutions: in particular, the quality of their annotations are compared to that of human interpretations. Next, lessons learnt from the differential analysis of these solutions are discussed. We expect that they will guide the design of efficient surgery monitoring tools in the near future.},

abstract = {The astounding success made by artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and other fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However, success always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized them into four categories: head {\&} neck, chest {\&} abdomen, pathology {\&} blood, and ``others''. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the methodology to test and evaluate their methods' performance and robustness on relevant datasets, 3) to provide a ``route'' to relevant algorithms for the relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.},

abstract = {Lung vessel segmentation has been widely explored by the biomedical image processing community; however, the differentiation of arterial from venous irrigation is still a challenge. Pulmonary artery–vein (AV) segmentation using computed tomography (CT) is growing in importance owing to its undeniable utility in multiple cardiopulmonary pathological states, especially those implying vascular remodelling, allowing the study of both flow systems separately. We present a new framework to approach the separation of tree-like structures using local information and a specifically designed graph-cut methodology that ensures connectivity as well as the spatial and directional consistency of the derived subtrees. This framework has been applied to the pulmonary AV classification using a random forest (RF) pre-classifier to exploit the local anatomical differences of arteries and veins. The evaluation of the system was performed using 192 bronchopulmonary segment phantoms, 48 anthropomorphic pulmonary CT phantoms, and 26 lungs from noncontrast CT images with precise voxel-based reference standards obtained by manually labelling the vessel trees. The experiments reveal a relevant improvement in the accuracy (∼ 20{\%}) of the vessel particle classification with the proposed framework with respect to using only the pre-classification based on local information applied to the whole area of the lung under study. The results demonstrated the accurate differentiation between arteries and veins in both clinical and synthetic cases, specifically when the image quality can guarantee a good airway segmentation, which opens a huge range of possibilities in the clinical study of cardiopulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {Abstract. Colour consistency in light microscopy based histology is an increasingly important problem with the advent of Gigapixel digital slide scanners and automatic image analysis. This paper presents an evaluation of two novel colour normalisation approaches against the previously utilised method of linear normalisation in l$\alpha$$\beta$ colourspace. These approaches map the colour distribution of an over/under stained image to that of a well stained target image. The first novel approach presented is a multi-modal extension to linear normalisation in l$\alpha$$\beta$ colourspace using an automatic image segmentation method and defining separate transforms for each class. The second approach normalises in a representation space obtained using stain specific colour deconvolution. Additionally, we present a method for estimation of the required colour deconvolution vectors directly from the image data. Our evaluation demonstrates the inherent variability in the original data, the known theoretical problems with linear normalisation in l$\alpha$$\beta$ colourspace, and that a multi-modal colour deconvolution based approach overcomes these problems. The segmentation based approach, while producing good results on the majority of images, is less successful than the colour deconvolution method for a significant minority of images as robust segmentation is required to avoid introducing artifacts.},

Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled ubiquitous internet access to biomedical datasets and techniques; in result, the progress in CADx is significant. Unlike the conventional CADx, deep learning techniques have the basic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature as they have the ability to learn mid and high level image representations. We proposed a Computer-Assisted Decision Support System in Pulmonary Cancer by using the novel deep learning based model and metastasis information obtained from MBAN (Medical Body Area Network). The proposed model, DFCNet, is based on the deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) which is used for classification of each detected pulmonary nodule into four lung cancer stages. The performance of proposed work is evaluated on different datasets with varying scan conditions. Comparison of proposed classifier is done with the existing CNN techniques. Overall accuracy of CNN and DFCNet was 77.6{\%} and 84.58{\%}, respectively. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the detection and classification of lung cancer nodules. These results demonstrate the potential for the proposed technique in helping the radiologists in improving nodule detection accuracy with efficiency.},

Recent research has given a better understanding of requirement in clinical eye care practice to identify better and cheaper ways of identification, management, diagnosis and treatment of retinal disease. The importance of diabetic retinopathy screening programs and difficulty in achieving reliable early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy at a reasonable cost needs attention to develop computer-aided diagnosis tool. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in retinal image analysis could ease mass screening of population with diabetes mellitus and help clinicians in utilizing their time more efficiently. The recent technological advances in computing power, communication systems, and machine learning techniques provide opportunities to the biomedical engineers and computer scientists to meet the requirements of clinical practice. Diverse and representative retinal image sets are essential for developing and testing digital screening programs and the automated algorithms at their core. To the best of our knowledge, the database for this challenge, IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset), is the first database representative of an Indian population. Moreover, it is the only dataset constituting typical diabetic retinopathy lesions and also normal retinal structures annotated at a pixel level. This dataset provides information on the disease severity of diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema for each image. This makes it perfect for development and evaluation of image analysis algorithms for early detection of diabetic retinopathy.},

We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE) neural network using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised procedure over a large data set of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder latent space provides a meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional description of each image. We then presented several thousand faces to human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied this mapping to novel test images, translating fMRI patterns into VAE latent codes, and codes into face reconstructions. The system not only performed robust pairwise decoding ({\textgreater}95{\%} correct), but also accurate gender classification, and even decoded which face was imagined, rather than seen.},

abstract = {Consistent spatial patterns of coherent activity, representing large-scale networks, have been reliably identified in multiple populations. Most often, these studies have examined "stationary" connectivity. However, there is a growing recognition that there is a wealth of information in the time-varying dynamics of networks which has neural underpinnings, which changes with age and disease and that supports behavior. Using factor analysis of overlapping sliding windows across 25 participants with Parkinson disease (PD) and 21 controls (ages 41-86), we identify factors describing the covarying correlations of regions (dynamic connectivity) within attention networks and the default mode network, during two baseline resting-state and task runs. Cortical regions that support attention networks are affected early in PD, motivating the potential utility of dynamic connectivity as a sensitive way to characterize physiological disruption to these networks. We show that measures of dynamic connectivity are more reliable than comparable measures of stationary connectivity. Factors in the dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal task control network, obtained at rest, are consistently related to the alerting and orienting reaction time effects in the subsequent Attention Network Task. In addition, the same relationship between the same DAN factor and the alerting effect was present during tasks. Although reliable, dynamic connectivity was not invariant, and changes between factor scores across sessions were related to changes in accuracy. In summary, patterns of time-varying correlations among nodes in an intrinsic network have a stability that has functional relevance.},

abstract = {Accurately segmenting retinal vessel from retinal images is essential for the detection and diagnosis of many eye diseases. However, it remains a challenging task due to (1) the large variations of scale in the retinal vessels and (2) the complicated anatomical context of retinal vessels, including complex vasculature and morphology, the low contrast between some vessels and the background, and the existence of exudates and hemorrhage. It is difficult for a model to capture representative and distinguishing features for retinal vessels under such large scale and semantics variations. Limited training data also make this task even harder. In order to comprehensively tackle these challenges, we propose a novel scale and context sensitive network (a.k.a., SCS−Net) for retinal vessel segmentation. We first propose a scale-aware feature aggregation (SFA) module, aiming at dynamically adjusting the receptive fields to effectively extract multi-scale features. Then, an adaptive feature fusion (AFF) module is designed to guide efficient fusion between adjacent hierarchical features to capture more semantic information. Finally, a multi-level semantic supervision (MSS) module is employed to learn more distinctive semantic representation for refining the vessel maps. We conduct extensive experiments on the six mainstream retinal image databases (DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, IOSTAR, HRF, and LES-AV). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCS-Net, which is capable of achieving better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art approaches, especially for the challenging cases with large scale variations and complex context environments.},

The network employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) to model potential function, followed by a CRF to perform structural learning. Because the mass distribution varies greatly with pixel position, the FCN is combined with position priori for the task. Due to the small size of mammogram datasets, we use adversarial training to control over-fitting. Four models with different convolutional kernels are further fused to improve the segmentation results. Experimental results on two public datasets, INbreast and DDSM-BCRP, show that our end-to-end network combined with adversarial training achieves the-state-of-the-art results.},

abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2012 James Bergstra and Yoshua Bengio.},

Segmentation of organs at risk (OAR) in computed tomography (CT) is of vital importance in radiotherapy treatment. This task is time consuming and for some organs, it is very challenging due to low-intensity contrast in CT. We propose a framework to perform the automatic segmentation of multiple OAR: esophagus, heart, trachea, and aorta. Different from previous works using deep learning techniques, we make use of global localization information, based on an original distance map that yields not only the localization of each organ, but also the spatial relationship between them. Instead of segmenting directly the organs, we first generate the localization map by minimizing a reconstruction error within an adversarial framework. This map that includes localization information of all organs is then used to guide the segmentation task in a fully convolutional setting.

The Palgrave Lacan Series, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-47533-2{\_}3

This book examines and explores Jacques Lacan's controversial topologisation of psychoanalysis, and seeks to persuade the reader that this enterprise was necessary and important. In providing both an introduction to a fundamental component of Lacan's theories, as well as readings of texts that have been largely ignored, it provides a thorough critical interpretation of his work. Will Greenshields argues that Lacan achieved his most pedagogically clear and successful presentations of his most essential and notoriously complex concepts – such as structure, the subject and the real – through the deployment of topology. The book will help readers to better understand Lacan, and also those concepts that have become prevalent in various intellectual discourses such as contemporary continental philosophy, politics and the study of ideology, and literary or cultural criticism.

abstract = {Interventional endoscopy (e.g., bronchoscopy, colonoscopy, laparoscopy, cystoscopy) is a widely performed procedure that involves either diagnosis of suspicious lesions or guidance for minimally invasive surgery in a variety of organs within the body cavity. Endoscopy may also be used to guide the introduction of certain items (e.g., stents) into the body. Endoscopic navigation systems seek to integrate big data with multimodal information (e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance images, endoscopic video sequences, ultrasound images, external trackers) relative to the patient's anatomy, control the movement of medical endoscopes and surgical tools, and guide the surgeon's actions during endoscopic interventions. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to realize the next generation of context-aware navigated endoscopy. This review presents a broad survey of various aspects of endoscopic navigation, particularly with respect to the development of endoscopic navigation techniques. First, we investigate big data with multimodal information involved in endoscopic navigation. Next, we focus on numerous methodologies used for endoscopic navigation. We then review different endoscopic procedures in clinical applications. Finally, we discuss novel techniques and promising directions for the development of endoscopic navigation.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: Engaging medical students during a radiology course can be challenging. We sought a way to actively engage students with live cases, allow them to interact with the picture archiving and communication system workstation, and experience what it is like to be a radiologist. Materials and Methods: Medical students enrolled in one of three radiology courses between May 2016 and June 2017 were eligible. The “Look Ahead” technique is as follows: a preceptor identifies several nonurgent imaging studies and allows the students to view the images first and make independent observations and conclusions. When ready, the students present their findings, receive feedback, and observe the preceptor generate a final report. Students completed the postcourse survey comparing the “Look Ahead” technique with the current standard (observing a preceptor interpret imaging studies with accompanying teaching points). Results: Thirty-four (56.7{\%}) of 60 potential respondents completed the postcourse survey. Of these 34, 24 (70.6{\%}) reported at least one reading room case (mean 4.6) in which the technique was employed, with a mean of 2.4 unique preceptors. When compared to the current standard (0 = not to 100 = very interested/engaged/valuable/memorable), the “Look Ahead” technique was associated with increased student-reported interest (92.5 vs 75.1, p {\textless} 0.01), engagement (94.0 vs 70.3, p {\textless} 0.01), educational value (92.5 vs 73.2, p {\textless} 0.01), memorability of the case (88.5 vs 73.2, p {\textless} 0.01) and of accompanying teaching points (90.1 vs 76.7, p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: The “Look Ahead” technique is a meaningful and engaging teaching method, which students find “interesting,” “valuable,” and “memorable.”},

abstract = {The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.},

abstract = {Histopathologic diagnosis relies on simultaneous integration of information from a broad range of scales, ranging from nuclear aberrations (≈O(0.1$\mu$m)) through cellular structures (≈O(10$\mu$m)) to the global tissue architecture (⪆O(1mm)). To explicitly mimic how human pathologists combine multi-scale information, we introduce a family of multi-encoder fully-convolutional neural networks with deep fusion. We present a simple block for merging model paths with differing spatial scales in a spatial relationship-preserving fashion, which can readily be included in standard encoder-decoder networks. Additionally, a context classification gate block is proposed as an alternative for the incorporation of global context. Our experiments were performed on three publicly available whole-slide images of recent challenges (PAIP 2019: hepatocellular carcinoma segmentation; BACH 2020: breast cancer segmentation; CAMELYON 2016: metastasis detection in lymph nodes). The multi-scale architectures consistently outperformed the baseline single-scale U-Nets by a large margin. They benefit from local as well as global context and particularly a combination of both. If feature maps from different scales are fused, doing so in a manner preserving spatial relationships was found to be beneficial. Deep guidance by a context classification loss appeared to improve model training at low computational costs. All multi-scale models had a reduced GPU memory footprint compared to ensembles of individual U-Nets trained on different image scales. Additional path fusions were shown to be possible at low computational cost, opening up possibilities for further, systematic and task-specific architecture optimisation. The findings demonstrate the potential of the presented family of human-inspired, end-to-end trainable, multi-scale multi-encoder fully-convolutional neural networks to improve deep histopathologic diagnosis by extensive integration of largely different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is a major health threat in many regions of the world. Opportunistic infections in immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients and multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains have exacerbated the problem, while diagnosing tuberculosis still remains a challenge. When left undiagnosed and thus untreated, mortality rates of patients with tuberculosis are high. Standard diagnostics still rely on methods developed in the last century. They are slow and often unreliable. In an effort to reduce the burden of the disease, this paper presents our automated approach for detecting tuberculosis in conventional posteroanterior chest radiographs. We first extract the lung region using a graph cut segmentation method. For this lung region, we compute a set of texture and shape features, which enable the X-rays to be classified as normal or abnormal using a binary classifier. We measure the performance of our system on two datasets: a set collected by the tuberculosis control program of our local county's health department in the United States, and a set collected by Shenzhen Hospital, China. The proposed computer-aided diagnostic system for TB screening, which is ready for field deployment, achieves a performance that approaches the performance of human experts. We achieve an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 87{\%} (78.3{\%} accuracy) for the first set, and an AUC of 90{\%} (84{\%} accuracy) for the second set. For the first set, we compare our system performance with the performance of radiologists. When trying not to miss any positive cases, radiologists achieve an accuracy of about 82{\%} on this set, and their false positive rate is about half of our system's rate. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Our contributions are: (i) a CNN architecture that predicts multiple gradings at once, and we propose variants of the architecture including using 3D convolutions; (ii) showing that this architecture can be trained using a multi-task loss function without requiring segmentation level annotation; and (iii) a localization method that clearly shows pathological regions in the disc volumes. We compare three visualization methods for the localization. The network is applied to a large corpus of MRI T2 sagittal spinal MRIs (using a standard clinical scan protocol) acquired from multiple machines, and is used to automatically compute disk and vertebra gradings for each MRI. These are: Pfirrmann grading, disc narrowing, upper/lower endplate defects, upper/lower marrow changes, spondylolisthesis, and central canal stenosis. We report near human performances across the eight gradings, and also visualize the evidence for these gradings localized on the original scans.},

To this end, we introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole-brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network architecture incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor network performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and subcortical structures. Further, we perform fast cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by directly mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (in under 1 ​min) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1 ​h runtime). For sustainability of this approach we perform extensive validation: we assert high segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure generalizability and demonstrate increased test-retest reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in dementia.},

abstract = {Policy search is a subfield in reinforcement learning which focuses on finding good parameters for a given policy parametrization. It is well suited for robotics as it can cope with high-dimensional state and action spaces, one of the main challenges in robot learning. We review recent successes of both model-free and model-based policy search in robot learning. Model-free policy search is a general approach to learn policies based on sampled trajectories. We classify model-free methods based on their policy evaluation strategy, policy update strategy, and exploration strategy and present a unified view on existing algorithms. Learning a policy is often easier than learning an accurate forward model, and, hence, model-free methods are more frequently used in practice. However, for each sampled trajectory, it is necessary to interact with the robot, which can be time consuming and challenging in practice. Model-based policy search addresses this problem by first learning a simulator of the robot's dynamics from data. Subsequently, the simulator generates trajectories that are used for policy learning. For both model-free and model-based policy search methods, we review their respective properties and their applicability to robotic systems.},

abstract = {Objectives: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice for imaging meningiomas. Volumetric assessment of meningiomas is highly relevant for therapy planning and monitoring. We used a multiparametric deep-learning model (DLM) on routine MRI data including images from diverse referring institutions to investigate DLM performance in automated detection and segmentation of meningiomas in comparison to manual segmentations. Methods: We included 56 of 136 consecutive preoperative MRI datasets [T1/T2-weighted, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE), FLAIR] of meningiomas that were treated surgically at the University Hospital Cologne and graded histologically as tumour grade I (n = 38) or grade II (n = 18). The DLM was trained on an independent dataset of 249 glioma cases and segmented different tumour classes as defined in the brain tumour image segmentation benchmark (BRATS benchmark). The DLM was based on the DeepMedic architecture. Results were compared to manual segmentations by two radiologists in a consensus reading in FLAIR and T1CE. Results: The DLM detected meningiomas in 55 of 56 cases. Further, automated segmentations correlated strongly with manual segmentations: average Dice coefficients were 0.81 ± 0.10 (range, 0.46-0.93) for the total tumour volume (union of tumour volume in FLAIR and T1CE) and 0.78 ± 0.19 (range, 0.27-0.95) for contrast-enhancing tumour volume in T1CE. Conclusions: The DLM yielded accurate automated detection and segmentation of meningioma tissue despite diverse scanner data and thereby may improve and facilitate therapy planning as well as monitoring of this highly frequent tumour entity. Key Points: • Deep learning allows for accurate meningioma detection and segmentation • Deep learning helps clinicians to assess patients with meningiomas • Meningioma monitoring and treatment planning can be improved.},

abstract = {We present an interpretation of Inception modules in con-volutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17, 000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

abstract = {Human cancers exhibit strong phenotypic differences that can be visualized noninvasively by medical imaging. Radiomics refers to the comprehensive quantification of tumour phenotypes by applying a large number of quantitative image features. Here we present a radiomic analysis of 440 features quantifying tumour image intensity, shape and texture, which are extracted from computed tomography data of 1,019 patients with lung or head-and-neck cancer. We find that a large number of radiomic features have prognostic power in independent data sets of lung and head-and-neck cancer patients, many of which were not identified as significant before. Radiogenomics analysis reveals that a prognostic radiomic signature, capturing intratumour heterogeneity, is associated with underlying gene-expression patterns. These data suggest that radiomics identifies a general prognostic phenotype existing in both lung and head-and-neck cancer. This may have a clinical impact as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision-support in cancer treatment at low cost. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We have therefore established the MRBrainS online evaluation framework for evaluating (semi)automatic algorithms that segment gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on 3T brain MRI scans of elderly subjects (65-80 y). Participants apply their algorithms to the provided data, after which their results are evaluated and ranked. Full manual segmentations of GM, WM, and CSF are available for all scans and used as the reference standard. Five datasets are provided for training and fifteen for testing. The evaluated methods are ranked based on their overall performance to segment GM, WM, and CSF and evaluated using three evaluation metrics (Dice, H95, and AVD) and the results are published on the MRBrainS13 website. We present the results of eleven segmentation algorithms that participated in the MRBrainS13 challenge workshop at MICCAI, where the framework was launched, and three commonly used freeware packages: FreeSurfer, FSL, and SPM.

@misc{Yin2019a,
abstract = {The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.},

@article{Kumar2018,
abstract = {The analysis of multi-modality positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) images for computer-aided diagnosis applications (e.g., detection and segmentation) requires combining the sensitivity of PET to detect abnormal regions with anatomical localization from CT. Current methods for PET-CT image analysis either process the modalities separately or fuse information from each modality based on knowledge about the image analysis task. These methods generally do not consider the spatially varying visual characteristics that encode different information across different modalities, which have different priorities at different locations. For example, a high abnormal PET uptake in the lungs is more meaningful for tumor detection than physiological PET uptake in the heart. Our aim is to improve the fusion of the complementary information in multi-modality PET-CT with a new supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to fuse complementary information for multi-modality medical image analysis. Our CNN first encodes modality-specific features and then uses them to derive a spatially varying fusion map that quantifies the relative importance of each modality's feature across different spatial locations. These fusion maps are then multiplied with the modality-specific feature maps to obtain a representation of the complementary multi-modality information at different locations, which can then be used for image analysis. We evaluated the ability of our CNN to detect and segment multiple regions (lungs, mediastinum, and tumors) with different fusion requirements using a dataset of PET-CT images of lung cancer. We compared our method to baseline techniques for multi-modality image fusion (fused inputs (FSs), multi-branch (MB) techniques, and multi-channel (MC) techniques) and segmentation. Our findings show that our CNN had a significantly higher foreground detection accuracy (99.29{\%}, p {\textless} {\{}0.05) than the fusion baselines (FS: 99.00{\%}, MB: 99.08{\%}, and TC: 98.92{\%}) and a significantly higher Dice score (63.85{\%}) than the recent PET-CT tumor segmentation methods.}},

However, there are not many deep structured applications used in medical imaging diagnosis area, because large dataset is not always available for medical images. In this study we tested the feasibility of using deep learning algorithms for lung cancer diagnosis with the cases from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) database. The nodules on each computed tomography (CT) slice were segmented according to marks provided by the radiologists. After down sampling and rotating we acquired 174412 samples with 52 by 52 pixel each and the corresponding truth files. Three deep learning algorithms were designed and implemented, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE). To compare the performance of deep learning algorithms with traditional computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system, we designed a scheme with 28 image features and support vector machine. The accuracies of CNN, DBNs, and SDAE are 0.7976, 0.8119, and 0.7929, respectively; the accuracy of our designed traditional CADx is 0.7940, which is slightly lower than CNN and DBNs. We also noticed that the mislabeled nodules using DBNs are 4{\%} larger than using traditional CADx, this might be resulting from down sampling process lost some size information of the nodules.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical overview and a performance evaluation of a novel z-sampling technique for multidetector row CT (MDCT), relying on a periodic motion of the focal spot in the longitudinal direction (z-flying focal spot) to double the number of simultaneously acquired slices. The z-flying focal spot technique has been implemented in a recently introduced MDCT scanner. Using 32 × 0.6 mm collimation, this scanner acquires 64 overlapping 0.6 mm slices per rotation in its spiral (helical) mode of operation, with the goal of improved longitudinal resolution and reduction of spiral artifacts. The longitudinal sampling distance at isocenter is 0.3 mm. We discuss in detail the impact of the z-flying focal spot technique on image reconstruction. We present measurements of spiral slice sensitivity profiles (SSPs) and of longitudinal resolution, both in the isocenter and off-center. We evaluate the pitch dependence of the image noise measured in a centered 20 cm water phantom. To investigate spiral image quality we present images of an anthropomorphic thorax phantom and patient scans. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spiral SSPs shows only minor variations as a function of the pitch, measured values differ by less than 0.15 mm from the nominal values 0.6, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm. The measured FWHM of the smallest slice ranges between 0.66 and 0.68 mm at isocenter, except for pitch 0.55 (0.72 mm). In a centered z-resolution phantom, bar patterns up to 15 lp/cm can be visualized independent of the pitch, corresponding to 0.33 mm longitudinal resolution. 100 mm off-center, bar patterns up to 14 lp/cm are visible, corresponding to an object size of 0.36 mm that can be resolved in the z direction. Image noise for constant effective mAs is almost independent of the pitch. Measured values show a variation of less than 7{\%} as a function of the pitch, which demonstrates correct utilization of the applied radiation dose at any pitch. The product of image noise and square root of the slice width (FWHM of the respective SSP) is the same constant for all slices except 0.6 mm. For the thinnest slice, relative image noise is increased by 17{\%}. Spiral windmill-type artifacts are effectively suppressed with the z-flying focal spot technique, which has the potential to maintain a low artifact level up to pitch 1.5, in this way increasing the maximum volume coverage speed that can be clinically used. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies is a series of neuroimaging data sets that are publicly available for study and analysis. The present MRI data set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96 years all acquired on the same scanner using identical sequences. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least 1 year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. Subjects were characterized using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) as either nondemented or with very mild tomild Alzheimer's disease. Seventy-two of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. Sixty-four of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with CDR 0.5 similar level of impairment to individuals elsewhere considered to have "mild cognitive impairment." Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit (CDR 0) and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit (CDR {\textgreater} 0). The subjects were all right-handed and include bothmen (n=62) and women (n = 88). For each scanning session, three or four individual T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained. Multiple withinsession acquisitions provide extremely high contrast to noise, making the data amenable to a wide range of analytic approaches including automated computational analysis. Automated calculation of whole-brain volume is presented to demonstrate use of the data for measuring differences associated with normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Meta-learning approaches have been proposed to tackle the few-shot learning problem. Typically, a meta-learner is trained on a variety of tasks in the hopes of being generalizable to new tasks. However, the generalizability on new tasks of a meta-learner could be fragile when it is over-trained on existing tasks during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined. Experiments on benchmarked datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks.},

abstract = {Spinal clinicians still rely on laborious workloads to conduct comprehensive assessments of multiple spinal structures in MRIs, in order to detect abnormalities and discover possible pathological factors. The objective of this work is to perform automated segmentation and classification (i.e., normal and abnormal) of intervertebral discs, vertebrae, and neural foramen in MRIs in one shot, which is called semantic segmentation that is extremely urgent to assist spinal clinicians in diagnosing neural foraminal stenosis, disc degeneration, and vertebral deformity as well as discovering possible pathological factors. However, no work has simultaneously achieved the semantic segmentation of intervertebral discs, vertebrae, and neural foramen due to three-fold unusual challenges: 1) Multiple tasks, i.e., simultaneous semantic segmentation of multiple spinal structures, are more difficult than individual tasks; 2) Multiple targets: average 21 spinal structures per MRI require automated analysis yet have high variety and variability; 3) Weak spatial correlations and subtle differences between normal and abnormal structures generate dynamic complexity and indeterminacy. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network called Spine-GAN for resolving above-aforementioned challenges. Firstly, Spine-GAN explicitly solves the high variety and variability of complex spinal structures through an atrous convolution (i.e., convolution with holes) autoencoder module that is capable of obtaining semantic task-aware representation and preserving fine-grained structural information. Secondly, Spine-GAN dynamically models the spatial pathological correlations between both normal and abnormal structures thanks to a specially designed long short-term memory module. Thirdly, Spine-GAN obtains reliable performance and efficient generalization by leveraging a discriminative network that is capable of correcting predicted errors and global-level contiguity. Extensive experiments on MRIs of 253 patients have demonstrated that Spine-GAN achieves high pixel accuracy of 96.2{\%}, Dice coefficient of 87.1{\%}, Sensitivity of 89.1{\%} and Specificity of 86.0{\%}, which reveals its effectiveness and potential as a clinical tool.},

The first method is using bit slices of a gray level image to create a layered version of the same image and the second method is to make use of a SUSAN edge detector and discriminate the pixels with enough thickness as bony structures. Then a neural network is used to classify images according to their geometrical specifications. Using NN for every new image, the possible coordinates of landmarks are estimated.

abstract = {With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology, and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89{\%} and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92{\%} . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org. The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on ultrasound lung images. In addition, it grants medical staff the option to (bulk) upload their own screenings in order to contribute to the growing public database of pathological lung ultrasound images.},

abstract = {Network quantization is one of network compression techniques to reduce the redundancy of deep neural networks. It reduces the number of distinct network parameter values by quantization in order to save the storage for them. In this paper, we design network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss due to quantization given a compression ratio constraint. We analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the neural network loss function and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function for the optimization of network quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative solution similar to Lloyd's algorithm. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, we show from our experiments that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable for LeNet, 32-layer ResNet and AlexNet, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain patterns.

abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the major causes of cancer death for men in the western world. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

In this work, we present two versions of Auto-Net, which provide automatically-tuned deep neural networks without any human intervention. The first version, Auto-Net 1.0, builds upon ideas from the competition-winning system Auto-sklearn by using the Bayesian Optimization method SMAC and uses Lasagne as the underlying deep learning (DL) library. The more recent Auto-Net 2.0 builds upon a recent combination of Bayesian Optimization and HyperBand, called BOHB, and uses PyTorch as DL library. To the best of our knowledge, Auto-Net 1.0 was the first automatically-tuned neural network to win competition datasets against human experts (as part of the first AutoML challenge). Further empirical results show that ensembling Auto-Net 1.0 with Auto-sklearn can perform better than either approach alone, and that Auto-Net 2.0 can perform better yet. 7.1},

abstract = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD($\lambda$). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed 'DeepLab' system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10–100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

abstract = {Many known supervised deep learning methods for medical image segmentation suffer an expensive burden of data annotation for model training. Recently, few-shot segmentation methods were proposed to alleviate this burden, but such methods often showed poor adaptability to the target tasks. By prudently introducing interactive learning into the few-shot learning strategy, we develop a novel few-shot segmentation approach called Interactive Few-shot Learning (IFSL), which not only addresses the annotation burden of medical image segmentation models but also tackles the common issues of the known few-shot segmentation methods. First, we design a new few-shot segmentation structure, called Medical Prior-based Few-shot Learning Network (MPrNet), which uses only a few annotated samples (e.g., 10 samples) as support images to guide the segmentation of query images without any pre-training. Then, we propose an Interactive Learning-based Test Time Optimization Algorithm (IL-TTOA) to strengthen our MPrNet on the fly for the target task in an interactive fashion. To our best knowledge, our IFSL approach is the first to allow few-shot segmentation models to be optimized and strengthened on the target tasks in an interactive and controllable manner. Experiments on four few-shot segmentation tasks show that our IFSL approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 20{\%} in the DSC metric. Specifically, the interactive optimization algorithm (IL-TTOA) further contributes {\&}{\#}x007E;10{\%} DSC improvement for the few-shot segmentation models.},

abstract = {In this work, we describe a new, general, and efficient method for unstructured point cloud labeling. As the question of efficiently using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on 3D data is still a pending issue, we propose a framework which applies CNNs on multiple 2D image views (or snapshots) of the point cloud. The approach consists in three core ideas. (i) We pick many suitable snapshots of the point cloud. We generate two types of images: a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) view and a depth composite view containing geometric features. (ii) We then perform a pixel-wise labeling of each pair of 2D snapshots using fully convolutional networks. Different architectures are tested to achieve a profitable fusion of our heterogeneous inputs. (iii) Finally, we perform fast back-projection of the label predictions in the 3D space using efficient buffering to label every 3D point. Experiments show that our method is suitable for various types of point clouds such as Lidar or photogrammetric data.},

Initiated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), further advanced by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), and accompanied by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through active participation, this public-private partnership demonstrates the success of a consortium founded on a consensus-based process. Seven academic centers and eight medical imaging companies collaborated to create this data set which contains 1018 cases. Each subject includes images from a clinical thoracic CT scan and an associated XML file that records the results of a two-phase image annotation process performed by four experienced thoracic radiologists. In the initial blinded-read phase, each radiologist independently reviewed each CT scan and marked lesions belonging to one of three categories ("nodule {\textgreater} or =3 mm," "nodule {\textless}3 mm," and "non-nodule {\textgreater} or =3 mm"). In the subsequent unblinded-read phase, each radiologist independently reviewed their own marks along with the anonymized marks of the three other radiologists to render a final opinion. The goal of this process was to identify as completely as possible all lung nodules in each CT scan without requiring forced consensus.},

In this work we develop a few-shot object detector that can learn to detect novel objects from only a few annotated examples. Our proposed model leverages fully labeled base classes and quickly adapts to novel classes, using a meta feature learner and a reweighting module within a one-stage detection architecture. The feature learner extracts meta features that are generalizable to detect novel object classes, using training data from base classes with sufficient samples. The reweighting module transforms a few support examples from the novel classes to a global vector that indicates the importance or relevance of meta features for detecting the corresponding objects. These two modules, together with a detection prediction module, are trained end-to-end based on an episodic few-shot learning scheme and a carefully designed loss function. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our model outperforms well-established baselines by a large margin for few-shot object detection, on multiple datasets and settings. We also present analysis on various aspects of our proposed model, aiming to provide some inspiration for future few-shot detection works.},

With the increased numbers of deep learning publications and openly available code, the approach to choosing a model for a new task becomes more complicated, while time and (computational) resources are limited. A possible solution to choosing a model efficiently is meta-learning, a learning method in which prior performance of a model is used to predict the performance for new tasks. We investigate meta-learning for segmentation across ten datasets of different organs and modalities. We propose four ways to represent each dataset by meta-features: one based on statistical features of the images and three are based on deep learning features. We use support vector regression and deep neural networks to learn the relationship between the meta-features and prior model performance. On three external test datasets these methods give Dice scores within 0.10 of the true performance. These results demonstrate the potential of meta-learning in medical imaging.},

abstract = {Imitation learning allows agents to learn complex behaviors from demonstrations. However, learning a complex vision-based task may require an impractical number of demonstrations. Meta-imitation learning is a promising approach towards enabling agents to learn a new task from one or a few demonstrations by leveraging experience from learning similar tasks. In the presence of task ambiguity or unobserved dynamics, demonstrations alone may not provide enough information; an agent must also try the task to successfully infer a policy. In this work, we propose a method that can learn to learn from both demonstrations and trial-and-error experience with sparse reward feedback. In comparison to meta-imitation, this approach enables the agent to effectively and efficiently improve itself autonomously beyond the demonstration data. In comparison to meta-reinforcement learning, we can scale to substantially broader distributions of tasks, as the demonstration reduces the burden of exploration. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches on a set of challenging, vision-based control tasks.},

abstract = {Accurate liver tumor segmentation without contrast agents (non-enhanced images) avoids the contrast-agent-associated time-consuming and high risk, which offers radiologists quick and safe assistance to diagnose and treat the liver tumor. However, without contrast agents enhancing, the tumor in liver images presents low contrast and even invisible to naked eyes. Thus the liver tumor segmentation from non-enhanced images is quite challenging. We propose a Weakly-Supervised Teacher-Student network (WSTS) to address the liver tumor segmentation in non-enhanced images by leveraging additional box-level-labeled data (labeled with a tumor bounding-box). WSTS deploys a weakly-supervised teacher-student framework (TCH-ST), namely, a Teacher Module learns to detect and segment the tumor in enhanced images during training, which facilitates a Student Module to detect and segment the tumor in non-enhanced images independently during testing. To detect the tumor accurately, the WSTS proposes a Dual-strategy DRL (DDRL), which develops two tumor detection strategies by creatively introducing a relative-entropy bias in the DRL. To accurately predict a tumor mask for the box-level-labeled enhanced image and thus improve tumor segmentation in non-enhanced images, the WSTS proposes an Uncertainty-Sifting Self-Ensembling (USSE). The USSE exploits the weakly-labeled data with self-ensembling and evaluates the prediction reliability with a newly-designed Multi-scale Uncertainty-estimation. WSTS is validated with a 2D MRI dataset, where the experiment achieves 83.11{\%} of Dice and 85.12{\%} of Recall in 50 patient testing data after training by 200 patient data (half amount data is box-level-labeled). Such a great result illustrates the competence of WSTS to segment the liver tumor from non-enhanced images. Thus, WSTS has excellent potential to assist radiologists by liver tumor segmentation without contrast-agents.},

In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, and achieves state-of-the-art results on 18 tasks including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},

However,to date,insufficient imaging samples with truly pathological-proven labels impede the evaluation of CNN models at scale. In this paper,we formulate a domain-adaptation framework that learns transferable deep features for patient-level lung cancer malignancy prediction. The presented work learns CNN-based features from a large discovery set (2272 lung nodules) with malignancy likelihood labels involving multiple radiologists' assessments,and then tests the transferable predictability of these CNN-based features on a diagnosis-definite set (115 cases) with true pathologically-proven lung cancer labels. We evaluate our approach on the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset,where both human expert labeling information on cancer malignancy likelihood and a set of pathologically-proven malignancy labels were provided. Experimental results demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the transferable deep features on predicting true patient-level lung cancer malignancy (Acc=70.69 {\%},AUC=0.66),which outperforms a nodule level CNN model (Acc=65.38 {\%},AUC=0.63) and is even comparable to that of using the radiologists' knowledge (Acc=72.41 {\%},AUC=0.76).

In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features - using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look.

We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning.

Specifically, the method is applied to the problem of myocardial segmentation combining the complementary information from multi-sequence (MS) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. For the image misalignment and incongruent data, the MvMM is formulated with transformations and is further generalized for dealing with the hetero-coverage multi-modality images (HC-MMIs). The segmentation of MvMM is performed in a virtual common space, to which all the images and misaligned slices are simultaneously registered. Furthermore, this common space can be divided into a number of sub-regions, each of which contains congruent data, thus the HC-MMIs can be modeled using a set of conventional MvMMs. Results show that MvMM obtained significantly better performance compared to the conventional approaches and demonstrated good potential for scar quantification as well as myocardial segmentation. The generalized MvMM has also demonstrated better robustness in the incongruent data, where some images may not fully cover the region of interest, and the full coverage can only be reconstructed combining the images from multiple sources.},

The new architecture performs multiplicative transformations and shares parameters of these transformations according to the subdivisions of the point clouds imposed onto them by kdtrees. Unlike the currently dominant convolutional architectures that usually require rasterization on uniform twodimensional or three-dimensional grids, Kd-networks do not rely on such grids in any way and therefore avoid poor scaling behavior. In a series of experiments with popular shape recognition benchmarks, Kd-networks demonstrate competitive performance in a number of shape recognition tasks such as shape classification, shape retrieval and shape part segmentation.},

abstract = {We introduce techniques for rapidly transferring the information stored in one neural net into another neural net. The main purpose is to accelerate the training of a significantly larger neural net. During real-world workflows, one often trains very many different neural networks during the experimentation and design process. This is a wasteful process in which each new model is trained from scratch. Our Net2Net technique accelerates the experimentation process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previous network to each new deeper or wider network. Our techniques are based on the concept of function-preserving transformations between neural network specifications. This differs from previous approaches to pre-training that altered the function represented by a neural net when adding layers to it. Using our knowledge transfer mechanism to add depth to Inception modules, we demonstrate a new state of the art accuracy rating on the ImageNet dataset.},

abstract = {Segmentation is fundamental to medical image analysis. Recent advances in fully convolutional networks has enabled automatic segmentation; however, high labeling efforts and difficulty in acquiring sufficient and high-quality training data is still a challenge. In this study, a cascaded 3D U-Net with active learning to increase training efficiency with exceedingly limited data and reduce labeling efforts is proposed. Abdominal computed tomography images of 50 kidneys were used for training. In stage I, 20 kidneys with renal cell carcinoma and four substructures were used for training by manually labelling ground truths. In stage II, 20 kidneys from the previous stage and 20 newly added kidneys were used with convolutional neural net (CNN)-corrected labelling for the newly added data. Similarly, in stage III, 50 kidneys were used. The Dice similarity coefficient was increased with the completion of each stage, and shows superior performance when compared with a recent segmentation network based on 3D U-Net. The labeling time for CNN-corrected segmentation was reduced by more than half compared to that in manual segmentation. Active learning was therefore concluded to be capable of reducing labeling efforts through CNN-corrected segmentation and increase training efficiency by iterative learning with limited data.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injuries may cause intracranial hemorrhages (ICH). ICH could lead to disability or death if it is not accurately diagnosed and treated in a time-sensitive procedure. The current clinical protocol to diagnose ICH is examining Computerized Tomography (CT) scans by radiologists to detect ICH and localize its regions. However, this process relies heavily on the availability of an experienced radiologist. In this paper, we designed a study protocol to collect a dataset of 82 CT scans of subjects with a traumatic brain injury. Next, the ICH regions were manually delineated in each slice by a consensus decision of two radiologists. The dataset is publicly available online at the PhysioNet repository for future analysis and comparisons. In addition to publishing the dataset, which is the main purpose of this manuscript, we implemented a deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), known as U-Net, to segment the ICH regions from the CT scans in a fully-automated manner. The method as a proof of concept achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.31 for the ICH segmentation based on 5-fold cross-validation.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks have demonstrated very promising performance on accurate segmentation of challenging organs (e.g., pancreas) in abdominal CT and MRI scans. The current deep learning approaches conduct pancreas segmentation by processing sequences of 2D image slices independently through deep, dense per-pixel masking for each image, without explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraint on segmentation of successive slices. We propose a new convolutional/recurrent neural network architecture to address the contextual learning and segmentation consistency problem. A deep convolutional sub-network is first designed and pre-trained from scratch. The output layer of this network module is then connected to recurrent layers and can be fine-tuned for contextual learning, in an end-to-end manner. Our recurrent sub-network is a type of Long short-term memory (LSTM) network that performs segmentation on an image by integrating its neighboring slice segmentation predictions, in the form of a dependent sequence processing. Additionally, a novel segmentation-direct loss function (named Jaccard Loss) is proposed and deep networks are trained to optimize Jaccard Index (JI) directly. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our proposed deep models, on quantitative pancreas segmentation using both CT and MRI scans. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art work on CT [11] and MRI pancreas segmentation [1], respectively.},

abstract = {The effort devoted to hand-crafting neural network image classifiers has motivated the use of architecture search to discover them automatically. Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones. Here, we evolve an image classifier-AmoebaNet-A-that surpasses hand-designs for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size, AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-the-art 83.9{\%} top-1 / 96.6{\%} top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality architectures.},

Segmentation of the LA from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) images is a complex problem. This manuscript presents a benchmark to evaluate algorithms that address LA segmentation. The datasets, ground truth and evaluation code have been made publicly available through the http://www.cardiacatlas.org website. This manuscript also reports the results of the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LASC) carried out at the STACOM'13 workshop, in conjunction with MICCAI'13. Thirty CT and 30 MRI datasets were provided to participants for segmentation. Each participant segmented the LA including a short part of the LA appendage trunk and proximal sections of the pulmonary veins (PVs). We present results for nine algorithms for CT and eight algorithms for MRI. Results showed that methodologies combining statistical models with region growing approaches were the most appropriate to handle the proposed task. The ground truth and automatic segmentations were standardised to reduce the influence of inconsistently defined regions (e.g., mitral plane, PVs end points, LA appendage). This standardisation framework, which is a contribution of this work, can be used to label and further analyse anatomical regions of the LA. By performing the standardisation directly on the left atrial surface, we can process multiple input data, including meshes exported from different electroanatomical mapping systems.},

It is reported that supervised contrastive learning applied to base class training in transductive few-shot training pipeline leads to improved results, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on Mini-ImageNet and CUB. Furthermore, our experiment shows that a much larger dataset is needed to retain few-shot classification accuracy when domain-shift degradation exists, and if our method is applied, the need for a large dataset is eliminated.

This paper tackles the challenging problem of domain generalization, i.e., learning a model from multi-domain source data such that it can directly generalize to an unseen target domain. We present a novel shape-aware meta-learning scheme to improve the model generalization in prostate MRI segmentation. Our learning scheme roots in the gradient-based meta-learning, by explicitly simulating domain shift with virtual meta-train and meta-test during training. Importantly, considering the deficiencies encountered when applying a segmentation model to unseen domains (i.e., incomplete shape and ambiguous boundary of the prediction masks), we further introduce two complementary loss objectives to enhance the meta-optimization, by particularly encouraging the shape compactness and shape smoothness of the segmentations under simulated domain shift. We evaluate our method on prostate MRI data from six different institutions with distribution shifts acquired from public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art generalization methods consistently across all six settings of unseen domains (Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/liuquande/SAML).},

A loss function based on the mixture of both Mean Square Error (MSE) and Dice Loss (DL) is used, in an attempt to combine the ability to capture the bulk shape as well as the reduction of local errors caused by over-segmentation. Results demonstrate a good performance in the middle region of the atria along with the challenges impact of capturing the pulmonary veins variability or valve plane identification that separates the atria to the ventricle.

Two distinct learning models (Model 1 and 2) are presented where both include subcortical area specific feature extraction, feature selection and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) deep neural network (DNN). The models learn highly complex and subtle differences in spatial atrophy patterns using white matter volumes, gray matter volumes, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and different types of Fractal Brownian Motion co-occurrence matrices for texture as features to classify AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in dementia patients. A five layer SAE with state-of-the-art dropout learning is trained on a publicly available ADNI dataset and the model performances are evaluated at two levels: one using in-house tenfold cross validation and another using the publicly available CADDementia competition. The in-house evaluations of our two models achieve 56.6{\%} and 58.0{\%} tenfold cross validation accuracies using 504 ADNI subjects. For the public domain evaluation, we are the first to report DNN to CADDementia and our methods yield competitive classification accuracies of 51.4{\%} and 56.8{\%}. Further, both of our proposed models offer higher True Positive Fraction (TPF) for AD class when compared to the top-overall ranked algorithm while Model 1 also ties for top diseased class sensitivity at 58.2{\%} in the CADDementia challenge. Finally, Model 2 achieves strong disease class sensitivity with improvement in specificity and overall accuracy. Our algorithms have the potential to provide a rapid, objective, and non-invasive assessment of AD.},

abstract = {Pre-processing is an important step in digital image matting, which aims to classify more accurate foreground and background pixels from the unknown region of the input three-region mask (Trimap). This step has no relation with the well-known matting equation and only compares color differences between the current unknown pixel and those known pixels. These newly classified pure pixels are then fed to the matting process as samples to improve the quality of the final matte. However, in the research field of image matting, the importance of pre-processing step is still blurry. Moreover, there are no corresponding review articles for this step, and the quantitative comparison of Trimap and alpha mattes after this step still remains unsolved. In this paper, the necessity and the importance of pre-processing step in image matting are firstly discussed in details. Next, current pre-processing methods are introduced by using the following two categories: static thresholding methods and dynamic thresholding methods. Analyses and experimental results show that static thresholding methods, especially the most popular iterative method, can make accurate pixel classifications in those general Trimaps with relatively fewer unknown pixels. However, in a much larger Trimap, there methods are limited by the conservative color and spatial thresholds. In contrast, dynamic thresholding methods can make much aggressive classifications on much difficult cases, but still strongly suffer from noises and false classifications. In addition, the sharp boundary detector is further discussed as a prior of pure pixels. Finally, summaries and a more effective approach are presented for pre-processing compared with the existing methods.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

abstract = {In the past decade, deep learning (DL) has achieved unprecedented success in numerous fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare. In particular, DL is experiencing an increasing development in applications for advanced medical image analysis in terms of analysis, segmentation, classification, and furthermore. On the one hand, tremendous needs that leverage the power of DL for medical image analysis are arising from the research community of a medical, clinical, and informatics background to jointly share their expertise, knowledge, skills, and experience. On the other hand, barriers between disciplines are on the road for them often hampering a full and efficient collaboration. To this end, we propose our novel open-source platform, i.e., MeDaS -- the MeDical open-source platform as Service. To the best of our knowledge, MeDaS is the first open-source platform proving a collaborative and interactive service for researchers from a medical background easily using DL related toolkits, and at the same time for scientists or engineers from information sciences to understand the medical knowledge side. Based on a series of toolkits and utilities from the idea of RINV (Rapid Implementation aNd Verification), our proposed MeDaS platform can implement pre-processing, post-processing, augmentation, visualization, and other phases needed in medical image analysis. Five tasks including the subjects of lung, liver, brain, chest, and pathology, are validated and demonstrated to be efficiently realisable by using MeDaS.},

abstract = {We present a library of efficient implementations of deep learning primitives. Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and optimizing their kernels is difficult and time-consuming. As parallel architectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized, which makes maintaining codebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the HPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS). However, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a library, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel processors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main computational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel processors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar in intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our implementation contains routines for GPUs, although similarly to the BLAS library, these routines could be implemented for other platforms. The library is easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized performance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a popular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36{\%} on a standard model while also reducing memory consumption.},

Arbitrary 3-D objects can be represented to any specified resolution in a hierarchical 8-ary tree structure or "octree" Objects may be concave or convex, have holes (including interior holes), consist of disjoint parts, and possess sculptured (i.e., "free-form") surfaces. The memory required for representation and manipulation is on the order of the surface area of the object. A complexity metric is proposed based on the number of nodes in an object's tree representation. Efficient (linear time) algorithms have been developed for the Boolean operations (union, intersection and difference), geometric operations (translation, scaling and rotation), N-dimensional interference detection, and display from any point in space with hidden surfaces removed. The algorithms require neither floating-point operations, integer multiplications, nor integer divisions. In addition, many independent sets of very simple calculations are typically generated, allowing implementation over many inexpensive high-bandwidth processors operating in parallel. Real time analysis and manipulation of highly complex situations thus becomes possible. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

During meta-learning, it learns to learn a deep distance metric to compare a small number of images within episodes, each of which is designed to simulate the few-shot setting. Once trained, a RN is able to classify images of new classes by computing relation scores between query images and the few examples of each new class without further updating the network. Besides providing improved performance on few-shot learning, our framework is easily extended to zero-shot learning. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our simple approach provides a unified and effective approach for both of these two tasks.},

This framework is more flexible and adaptive for high dimensional action and state spaces than existing reinforcement learning methods to model real-life complexity in heterogeneous disease progression and treatment choices, with the goal of providing doctors and patients the data-driven personalized decision recommendations. The proposed DRL framework comprises (i) a supervised learning step to predict expert actions, and (ii) a deep reinforcement learning step to estimate the long-term value function of Dynamic Treatment Regimes. Both steps depend on deep neural networks. As a key motivational example, we have implemented the proposed framework on a data set from the Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry database, focusing on the sequence of prevention and treatments for acute and chronic graft versus host disease after transplantation. In the experimental results, we have demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting human experts' decisions, as well as the high expected reward function in the DRL-based dynamic treatment regimes.},

abstract = {The systematic study of nuclei patterns in pathology images is very important for fully charactering the grade of cancerous tissues. Nowadays, with the great advance of deep neural networks (i.e., DNN), intense interest in adopting DNN to distinguish different types of pathology nuclei is widely spread. However, most of the existing methods need to annotate lots of nuclei images in the training stage, and this is not always an option for the labelling cost are high. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach called DAPC (i.e., deep active learning with pairwise constraints) to actively select the most valuable nuclei for annotation. Specifically, we firstly design a novel pairwise-constraint regularized deep convolutional neural network (i.e., CNN) that can simultaneously preserve the distribution of different subjects and optimize the objective criterion of conventional CNN. Then, through the properly designed CNN, we query the most informative nuclei in the unlabelled dataset for human annotation, and the parameters of the designed CNN is subsequently updated by incorporating the newly annotated samples to enhance the CNNs performance incrementally. We evaluate our method on a public available pathology colon dataset, the experimental results show that the proposed method could achieves to a weighted F1-score of 79.2{\%} by only annotating 60{\%} nuclei in the training set, which is better than the comparing methods.},

abstract = {Quantification of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin is of key importance in many neurological research studies. Currently, measurements are often still obtained from manual segmentations on brain MR images, which is a laborious procedure. The automatic WMH segmentation methods exist, but a standardized comparison of the performance of such methods is lacking. We organized a scientific challenge, in which developers could evaluate their methods on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset, giving an objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge. Sixty T1 + FLAIR images from three MR scanners were released with the manual WMH segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR scanners was used for evaluation. The segmentation methods had to be containerized and submitted to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation metrics were used to rank the methods: 1) Dice similarity coefficient; 2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th percentile); 3) absolute log-transformed volume difference; 4) sensitivity for detecting individual lesions; and 5) F1-score for individual lesions. In addition, the methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness; 20 participants submitted their methods for evaluation. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of four methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all the methods generalize to unseen scanners. The challenge remains open for future submissions and provides a public platform for method evaluation.},

abstract = {Automatic organ segmentation is an important yet challenging problem for medical image analysis. The pancreas is an abdominal organ with very high anatomical variability. This inhibits previous segmentation methods from achieving high accuracies, especially compared to other organs such as the liver, heart or kidneys. In this paper, we present a probabilistic bottom-up approach for pancreas segmentation in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, using multi-level deep convolutional networks (ConvNets). We propose and evaluate several variations of deep ConvNets in the context of hierarchical, coarse-tofine classification on image patches and regions, i.e. superpixels. We first present a dense labeling of local image patches via P-ConvNet and nearest neighbor fusion. Then we describe a regional ConvNet (R1−ConvNet) that samples a set of bounding boxes around each image superpixel at different scales of contexts in a “zoom-out” fashion. Our ConvNets learn to assign class probabilities for each superpixel region of being pancreas. Last, we study a stacked R2−ConvNet leveraging the joint space of CT intensities and the P−ConvNet dense probability maps. Both 3D Gaussian smoothing and 2D conditional random fields are exploited as structured predictions for post-processing. We evaluate on CT images of 82 patients in 4-fold cross-validation. We achieve a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 83.6±6.3{\%} in training and 71.8±10.7{\%} in testing.},

abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},

To address this, we propose a novel Single-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (SO-GAAL) method for outlier detection, which can directly generate informative potential outliers based on the mini-max game between a generator and a discriminator. Moreover, to prevent the generator from falling into the mode collapsing problem, the stop node of training should be determined when SO-GAAL is able to provide sufficient information. But without any prior information, it is extremely difficult for SO-GAAL. Therefore, we expand the network structure of SO-GAAL from a single generator to multiple generators with different objectives (MO-GAAL), which can generate a reasonable reference distribution for the whole dataset. We empirically compare the proposed approach with several state-of-the-art outlier detection methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that MO-GAAL outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases, especially for datasets with various cluster types or high irrelevant variable ratio.},

abstract = {Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9{\%} with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5{\%}on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication.},

The MICCAI challenge discussed in this paper, which concerns the detection of diabetic foot ulcers, will accelerate the development of innovative healthcare technology to address this unmet medical need. In an effort to improve patient care and reduce the strain on healthcare systems, recent research has focused on the creation of cloud-based detection algorithms that can be consumed as a service by a mobile app that patients (or a carer, partner or family member) could use themselves to monitor their condition and to detect the appearance of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Collaborative work between Manchester Metropolitan University, Lancashire Teaching Hospital and the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust has created a repository of 4000 DFU images for the purpose of supporting research toward more advanced methods of DFU detection. Based on a joint effort involving the lead scientists of the UK, US, India and New Zealand, this challenge will solicit original work, and promote interactions between researchers and interdisciplinary collaborations. This paper presents a dataset description and analysis, assessment methods, benchmark algorithms and initial evaluation results. It facilitates the challenge by providing useful insights into state-of-the-art and ongoing research.},

abstract = {Understanding the connectivity in the brain is an important prerequisite for understanding how the brain processes information. In the Brain/MINDS project, a connectivity study on marmoset brains uses two-photon microscopy fluorescence images of axonal projections to collect the neuron connectivity from defined brain regions at the mesoscopic scale. The processing of the images requires the detection and segmentation of the axonal tracer signal. The objective is to detect as much tracer signal as possible while not misclassifying other background structures as the signal. This can be challenging because of imaging noise, a cluttered image background, distortions or varying image contrast cause problems. We are developing MarmoNet, a pipeline that processes and analyzes tracer image data of the common marmoset brain. The pipeline incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning techniques based on artificial convolutional neural networks (CNN) and image registration techniques to extract and map all relevant information in a robust manner. The pipeline processes new images in a fully automated way. This report introduces the current state of the tracer signal analysis part of the pipeline.},

Accurate tumor delineation from PET and CT plays an important role in radiation therapy. The PET-CT co-segmentation technique, which makes use of advantages of both modalities, has achieved impressive performance for tumor delineation. In this work, we propose a novel 3D image matting based semi-automated co-segmentation method for tumor delineation on dual PET-CT scans. The “matte” values generated by 3D image matting are employed to compute the region costs for the graph based co-segmentation. Compared to previous PET-CT co-segmentation methods, our method is completely data-driven in the design of cost functions, thus using much less hyper-parameters in our segmentation model. Comparative experiments on 54 PET-CT scans of lung cancer patients demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

While remarkably successful, current methods require access to many images in both source and destination classes at training time. We argue this greatly limits their use. Drawing inspiration from the human capability of picking up the essence of a novel object from a small number of examples and generalizing from there, we seek a few-shot, unsupervised image-to-image translation algorithm that works on previously unseen target classes that are specified, at test time, only by a few example images. Our model achieves this few-shot generation capability by coupling an adversarial training scheme with a novel network design. Through extensive experimental validation and comparisons to several baseline methods on benchmark datasets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether a multivariate machine learning-based model using computer-extracted features of pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer patients. Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study of 288 breast cancer patients at our institution who received NAT and had a pre-treatment breast MRI. A comprehensive set of 529 radiomic features was extracted from each patient's pre-treatment MRI. The patients were divided into equal groups to form a training set and an independent test set. Two multivariate machine learning models (logistic regression and a support vector machine) based on imaging features were trained to predict pCR in (a) all patients with NAT, (b) patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), and (c) triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (TN/HER2+) patients who had NAT. The multivariate models were tested using the independent test set, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: Out of the 288 patients, 64 achieved pCR. The AUC values for predicting pCR in TN/HER+ patients who received NAT were significant (0.707, 95{\%} CI 0.582–0.833, p {\textless} 0.002). Conclusions: The multivariate models based on pre-treatment MRI features were able to predict pCR in TN/HER2+ patients.},

We adopt a model-agnostic learning paradigm with gradient-based meta-train and meta-test procedures to expose the optimization to domain shift. Further, we introduce two complementary losses which explicitly regularize the semantic structure of the feature space. Globally, we align a derived soft confusion matrix to preserve general knowledge about inter-class relationships. Locally, we promote domain-independent class-specific cohesion and separation of sample features with a metric-learning component. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with new state-of-the-art results on two common object recognition benchmarks.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We compile an annotated image dataset of over 18,000 white blood cells, use it to train a convolutional neural network for leukocyte classification, and evaluate the network's performance. The network classifies the most important cell types with high accuracy. It also allows us to decide two clinically relevant questions with human-level performance, namely (i) if a given cell has blast character, and (ii) if it belongs to the cell types normally present in non-pathological blood smears. Our approach holds the potential to be used as a classification aid for examining much larger numbers of cells in a smear than can usually be done by a human expert. This will allow clinicians to recognize malignant cell populations with lower prevalence at an earlier stage of the disease.},

abstract = {Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is the preferred method for diagnosing knee injuries. However, interpretation of knee MRI is time-intensive and subject to diagnostic error and variability. An automated system for interpreting knee MRI could prioritize high-risk patients and assist clinicians in making diagnoses. Deep learning methods, in being able to automatically learn layers of features, are well suited for modeling the complex relationships between medical images and their interpretations. In this study we developed a deep learning model for detecting general abnormalities and specific diagnoses (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] tears and meniscal tears) on knee MRI exams. We then measured the effect of providing the model's predictions to clinical experts during interpretation. Methods and findings: Our dataset consisted of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2012 (mean age 38.0 years; 569 [41.5{\%}] female patients). The majority vote of 3 musculoskeletal radiologists established reference standard labels on an internal validation set of 120 exams. We developed MRNet, a convolutional neural network for classifying MRI series and combined predictions from 3 series per exam using logistic regression. In detecting abnormalities, ACL tears, and meniscal tears, this model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.937 (95{\%} CI 0.895, 0.980), 0.965 (95{\%} CI 0.938, 0.993), and 0.847 (95{\%} CI 0.780, 0.914), respectively, on the internal validation set. We also obtained a public dataset of 917 exams with sagittal T1-weighted series and labels for ACL injury from Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia. On the external validation set of 183 exams, the MRNet trained on Stanford sagittal T2-weighted series achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95{\%} CI 0.757, 0.892) in the detection of ACL injuries with no additional training, while an MRNet trained on the rest of the external data achieved an AUC of 0.911 (95{\%} CI 0.864, 0.958). We additionally measured the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of 9 clinical experts (7 board-certified general radiologists and 2 orthopedic surgeons) on the internal validation set both with and without model assistance. Using a 2-sided Pearson's chi-squared test with adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found no significant differences between the performance of the model and that of unassisted general radiologists in detecting abnormalities. General radiologists achieved significantly higher sensitivity in detecting ACL tears (p-value = 0.002; q-value = 0.019) and significantly higher specificity in detecting meniscal tears (p-value = 0.003; q-value = 0.019). Using a 1-tailed t test on the change in performance metrics, we found that providing model predictions significantly increased clinical experts' specificity in identifying ACL tears (p-value {\textless} 0.001; q-value = 0.006). The primary limitations of our study include lack of surgical ground truth and the small size of the panel of clinical experts. Conclusions: Our deep learning model can rapidly generate accurate clinical pathology classifications of knee MRI exams from both internal and external datasets. Moreover, our results support the assertion that deep learning models can improve the performance of clinical experts during medical imaging interpretation. Further research is needed to validate the model prospectively and to determine its utility in the clinical setting.},

Current automatic (multi-) atlas-based segmentation strategies often lack accuracy on difficult-to-segment brain structures and, since these methods rely on atlas-to-scan alignment, they may take long processing times. Alternatively, recent methods deploying solutions based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are enabling the direct analysis of out-of-the-scanner data. However, current CNN-based solutions partition the test volume into 2D or 3D patches, which are processed independently. This process entails a loss of global contextual information, thereby negatively impacting the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we design and test an optimised end-to-end CNN architecture that makes the exploitation of global spatial information computationally tractable, allowing to process a whole MRI volume at once. We adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy by exploiting a large dataset composed of 947 out-of-the-scanner (3 Tesla T1-weighted 1mm isotropic MP-RAGE 3D sequences) MR Images. The resulting model is able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation results in only a few seconds. Different quantitative measures demonstrate an improved accuracy of our solution when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, through a randomised survey involving expert neuroscientists, we show that subjective judgements favour our solution with respect to widely adopted atlas-based software.},

abstract = {Structural changes to the wall of the left atrium are known to occur with conditions that predispose to Atrial fibrillation. Imaging studies have demonstrated that these changes may be detected non-invasively. An important indicator of this structural change is the wall's thickness. Present studies have commonly measured the wall thickness at few discrete locations. Dense measurements with computer algorithms may be possible on cardiac scans of Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The task is challenging as the atrial wall is a thin tissue and the imaging resolution is a limiting factor. It is unclear how accurate algorithms may get and how they compare in this new emerging area. We approached this problem of comparability with the Segmentation of Left Atrial Wall for Thickness (SLAWT) challenge organised in conjunction with MICCAI 2016 conference. This manuscript presents the algorithms that had participated and evaluation strategies for comparing them on the challenge image database that is now open-source. The image database consisted of cardiac CT (n=10) and MRI (n=10) of healthy and diseased subjects. A total of 6 algorithms were evaluated with different metrics, with 3 algorithms in each modality. Segmentation of the wall with algorithms was found to be feasible in both modalities. There was generally a lack of accuracy in the algorithms and inter-rater differences showed that algorithms could do better. Benchmarks were determined and algorithms were ranked to allow future algorithms to be ranked alongside the state-of-the-art techniques presented in this work. A mean atlas was also constructed from both modalities to illustrate the variation in thickness within this small cohort.},

abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that has received increasing attention from both the computer vision and the natural language processing communities. Given an image and a question in natural language, it requires reasoning over visual elements of the image and general knowledge to infer the correct answer. In the first part of this survey, we examine the state of the art by comparing modern approaches to the problem. We classify methods by their mechanism to connect the visual and textual modalities. In particular, we examine the common approach of combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to map images and questions to a common feature space. We also discuss memory-augmented and modular architectures that interface with structured knowledge bases. In the second part of this survey, we review the datasets available for training and evaluating VQA systems. The various datatsets contain questions at different levels of complexity, which require different capabilities and types of reasoning. We examine in depth the question/answer pairs from the Visual Genome project, and evaluate the relevance of the structured annotations of images with scene graphs for VQA. Finally, we discuss promising future directions for the field, in particular the connection to structured knowledge bases and the use of natural language processing models.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of semantic annotation on 3D models that are represented as shape graphs. A functional view is taken to represent localized information on graphs, so that annotations such as part segment or keypoint are nothing but 0-1 indicator vertex functions. Compared with images that are 2D grids, shape graphs are irregular and non-isomorphic data structures. To enable the prediction of vertex functions on them by convolutional neural networks, we resort to spectral CNN method that enables weight sharing by parametrizing kernels in the spectral domain spanned by graph Laplacian eigenbases. Under this setting, our network, named SyncSpecCNN, strives to overcome two key challenges: how to share coefficients and conduct multi-scale analysis in different parts of the graph for a single shape, and how to share information across related but different shapes that may be represented by very different graphs. Towards these goals, we introduce a spectral parametrization of dilated convolutional kernels and a spectral transformer network. Experimentally we tested SyncSpecCNN on various tasks, including 3D shape part segmentation and keypoint prediction. State-of-the-art performance has been achieved on all benchmark datasets.},

We present a decoding approach for arbitrary objects using the machine vision principle that an object category is represented by a set of features rendered invariant through hierarchical processing. We show that visual features, including those derived from a deep convolutional neural network, can be predicted from fMRI patterns, and that greater accuracy is achieved for low-/high-level features with lower-/higher-level visual areas, respectively. Predicted features are used to identify seen/imagined object categories (extending beyond decoder training) from a set of computed features for numerous object images. Furthermore, decoding of imagined objects reveals progressive recruitment of higher-to-lower visual representations. Our results demonstrate a homology between human and machine vision and its utility for brain-based information retrieval.},

Network morphism, which keeps the functionality of a neural network while changing its neural architecture, could be helpful for NAS by enabling more efficient training during the search. In this paper, we propose a novel framework enabling Bayesian optimization to guide the network morphism for efficient neural architecture search. The framework develops a neural network kernel and a tree-structured acquisition function optimization algorithm to efficiently explores the search space. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets have been done to demonstrate the superior performance of the developed framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we build an open-source AutoML system based on our method, namely Auto-Keras. The code and documentation are available at https://autokeras.com.

abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, research focuses on the early computer-aided diagnosis of dementia with the goal to understand the disease process, determine risk and preserving factors, and explore preventive therapies. By now, large amounts of data from multi-site studies have been made available for developing, training, and evaluating automated classifiers. Yet, their translation to the clinic remains challenging, in part due to their limited generalizability across different datasets. In this work, we describe a compact classification approach that mitigates overfitting by regularizing the multinomial regression with the mixed ℓ1/ℓ2 norm. We combine volume, thickness, and anatomical shape features from MRI scans to characterize neuroanatomy for the three-class classification of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. We demonstrate high classification accuracy via independent evaluation within the scope of the CADDementia challenge. We, furthermore, demonstrate that variations between source and target datasets can substantially influence classification accuracy. The main contribution of this work addresses this problem by proposing an approach for supervised domain adaptation based on instance weighting. Integration of this method into our classifier allows us to assess different strategies for domain adaptation. Our results demonstrate (i) that training on only the target training set yields better results than the na{\"{i}}ve combination (union) of source and target training sets, and (ii) that domain adaptation with instance weighting yields the best classification results, especially if only a small training component of the target dataset is available. These insights imply that successful deployment of systems for computer-aided diagnostics to the clinic depends not only on accurate classifiers that avoid overfitting, but also on a dedicated domain adaptation strategy.},

To enable fair comparison between the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 Conference in Melbourne. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided with 899 whole-slide images (WSIs) for developing their algorithms. The developed algorithms were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 WSIs. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the 10 best pre-conference and two post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in neural network architecture, training strategy, and pre- and postprocessing methodology. Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below 40{\%}. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targeted for further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93 for the best combination.},

In this paper, we present a nonrigid registration-driven robust lung segmentation method using image retrieval-based patient specific adaptive lung models that detects lung boundaries, surpassing state-of-the-art performance. The method consists of three main stages: 1) a content-based image retrieval approach for identifying training images (with masks) most similar to the patient CXR using a partial Radon transform and Bhattacharyya shape similarity measure, 2) creating the initial patient-specific anatomical model of lung shape using SIFT-flow for deformable registration of training masks to the patient CXR, and 3) extracting refined lung boundaries using a graph cuts optimization approach with a customized energy function. Our average accuracy of 95.4{\%} on the public JSRT database is the highest among published results.

discriminate classes with only a small number of labelled examples. Most of the literature considers the problem of labelling a single unknown input at a time. Instead, it can be beneficial to consider a setting where a batch of unlabelled inputs are treated conjointly and non-independently. In this vein, we propose a method able to exploit three levels of information: a) feature extractors pretrained on generic datasets, b) few labelled examples of classes to discriminate and c) other available unlabelled inputs. If for a), we use state-of-the-art approaches, we introduce the use of simplified graph convolutions to perform b) and c) together. Our proposed model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy with a 6 − 11{\%} increase compared to available alternatives on standard few-shot vision classification datasets.},

abstract = {Compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineation of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bony structures can avoid harmful radiation exposure. However, bony boundaries are blurry in MRI, and structural information needs to be borrowed from CT during the training. This is challenging since paired MRI-CT data are typically scarce. In this paper, we propose to make full use of unpaired data, which are typically abundant, along with a single paired MRI-CT data to construct a one-shot generative adversarial model for automated MRI segmentation of CMF bony structures. Our model consists of a cross-modality image synthesis sub-network, which learns the mapping between CT and MRI, and an MRI segmentation sub-network. These two sub-networks are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, in the training phase, a neighbor-based anchoring method is proposed to reduce the ambiguity problem inherent in cross-modality synthesis, and a feature-matching-based semantic consistency constraint is proposed to encourage segmentation-oriented MRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison with the state-of-the-art MRI segmentation methods.},

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of infant brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid is an indispensable foundation for early studying of brain growth patterns and morphological changes in neurodevelopmental disorders. Nevertheless, in the isointense phase (approximately 6-9months of age), due to inherentmyelination andmaturation process, WM and GM exhibit similar levels of intensity in both T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images, making tissue segmentation very challenging. Although many efforts were devoted to brain segmentation, only a few studies have focused on the segmentation of six-month infant brain images. With the idea of boosting methodological development in the community, iSeg-2017 challenge (http://iseg2017.web.unc.edu) provides a set of six-month infant subjects with manual labels for training and testing the participating methods. Among the 21 automatic segmentation methods participating in iSeg-2017, we review the eight top-ranked teams, in terms of Dice ratio, modified Hausdorff distance, and average surface distance, and introduce their pipelines, implementations, as well as source codes. We further discuss the limitations and possible future directions. We hope the dataset in iSeg-2017, and this paper could provide insights into methodological development for the community.},

abstract = {Purpose To assess the potential of histogram metrics of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)-derived indices in revealing neurodegeneration and its progression in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Materials and methods Nine SCA2 patients and 16 age-matched healthy controls, were examined twice (SCA2 patients 3.6±0.7 years and controls 3.3±1.0 years apart) on the same 1.5T scanner by acquiring T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted (b-value = 1000 s/mm2) images. Cerebrum and brainstem-cerebellum regions were segmented using FreeSurfer suite. Histogram analysis of DTI-derived indices, including mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) / radial (RD) diffusivity and mode of anisotropy (MO), was performed. Results At baseline, significant differences between SCA2 patients and controls were confined to brainstem-cerebellum. Median values of MD/AD/RD and FA/MO were significantly (p{\textless}0.001) higher and lower, respectively, in SCA2 patients (1.11/1.30/1.03×10−3 mm2/s and 0.14/0.19) than in controls (0.80/1.00/0.70×10−3 mm2/s and 0.20/0.41). Also, peak location values of MD/AD/RD and FA were significantly (p{\textless}0.001) higher and lower, respectively, in SCA2 patients (0.91/1.11/0.81×10−3 mm2/s and 0.12) than in controls (0.71/0.91/0.63×10−3 mm2/s and 0.18). Peak height values of FA and MD/AD/RD/MO were significantly (p{\textless}0.001) higher and lower, respectively, in SCA2 patients (0.20 and 0.07/0.06/0.07×10−3 mm2/s/year /0.07) than in controls (0.15 and 0.14/0.11/0.12/×10−3 mm2/s/year /0.09). The rate of change of MD median values was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) higher (i.e., increased) in SCA2 patients (0.010×10−3 mm2/s/year) than in controls (-0.003×10−3 mm2/s/year) in the brainstem-cerebellum, whereas no significant difference was found for other indices and in the cerebrum. Conclusion Histogram analysis of DTI-derived indices is a relatively straightforward approach which reveals microstructural changes associated with pontocerebellar degeneration in SCA2 and the median value of MD is capable to track its progression.},

abstract = {The detection of microaneurysms in digital color fundus photographs is a critical first step in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication of diabetes. To accomplish this detection numerous methods have been published in the past but none of these was compared with each other on the same data. In this work we present the results of the first international microaneurysm detection competition, organized in the context of the Retinopathy Online Challenge (ROC), a multiyear online competition for various aspects of DR detection. For this competition, we compare the results of five different methods, produced by five different teams of researchers on the same set of data. The evaluation was performed in a uniform manner using an algorithm presented in this work. The set of data used for the competition consisted of 50 training images with available reference standard and 50 test images where the reference standard was witheld by the organizers (M. Niemeijer, B. van Ginneken, and M. D. Abrmoff). The results obtained on the test data was submitted through a website after which standardized evaluation software was used to determine the performance of each of the methods. A human expert detected microaneurysms in the test set to allow comparison with the performance of the automatic methods. The overall results show that microaneurysm detection is a challenging task for both the automatic methods as well as the human expert. There is room for improvement as the best performing system does not reach the performance of the human expert. The data associated with the ROC microaneurysm detection competition will remain publicly available and the website will continue accepting submissions. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The purpose of active learning is to significantly reduce the cost of annotation while ensuring the good performance of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method based on the combination of pool and synthesis named dual generative adversarial active learning (DGAAL), which includes the functions of image generation and representation learning. This method includes two groups of generative adversarial network composed of a generator and two discriminators. One group is used for representation learning, and then this paper performs sampling based on the predicted value of the discriminator. The other group is used for image generation. The purpose is to generate samples which are similar to those obtained from sampling, so that samples with rich information can be fully utilized. In the sampling process, the two groups of network cooperate with each other to enable the generated samples to participate in sampling process, and to enable the discriminator for sampling to co-evolve. Thus, in the later stage of sampling, the problem of insufficient information for selecting samples based on the pool method is alleviated. In this paper, DGAAL is evaluated extensively on three data sets, and the results show that DGAAL not only has certain advantages over the existing methods in terms of model performance but can also further reduces the annotation cost.},

abstract = {This paper presents the evaluation results of the methods submitted to Challenge US: Biometric Measurements from Fetal Ultrasound Images, a segmentation challenge held at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2012. The challenge was set to compare and evaluate current fetal ultrasound image segmentation methods. It consisted of automatically segmenting fetal anatomical structures to measure standard obstetric biometric parameters, from 2D fetal ultrasound images taken on fetuses at different gestational ages (21 weeks, 28 weeks, and 33 weeks) and with varying image quality to reflect data encountered in real clinical environments. Four independent sub-challenges were proposed, according to the objects of interest measured in clinical practice: abdomen, head, femur, and whole fetus. Five teams participated in the head sub-challenge and two teams in the femur sub-challenge, including one team who tackled both. Nobody attempted the abdomen and whole fetus sub-challenges. The challenge goals were two-fold and the participants were asked to submit the segmentation results as well as the measurements derived from the segmented objects. Extensive quantitative (region-based, distance-based, and Bland-Altman measurements) and qualitative evaluation was performed to compare the results from a representative selection of current methods submitted to the challenge. Several experts (three for the head sub-challenge and two for the femur sub-challenge), with different degrees of expertise, manually delineated the objects of interest to define the ground truth used within the evaluation framework. For the head sub-challenge, several groups produced results that could be potentially used in clinical settings, with comparable performance to manual delineations. The femur sub-challenge had inferior performance to the head sub-challenge due to the fact that it is a harder segmentation problem and that the techniques presented relied more on the femur's appearance. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Accurate lung tumor delineation plays an important role in radiotherapy treatment planning. Since the lung tumor has poor boundary in positron emission tomography (PET) images and low contrast in computed tomography (CT) images, segmentation of tumor in the PET and CT images is a challenging task. In this paper, we effectively integrate the two modalities by making fully use of the superior contrast of PET images and superior spatial resolution of CT images. Random walk and graph cut method is integrated to solve the segmentation problem, in which random walk is utilized as an initialization tool to provide object seeds for graph cut segmentation on the PET and CT images. The co-segmentation problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem which is solved by max-flow/min-cut method. A graph, including two sub-graphs and a special link, is constructed, in which one sub-graph is for the PET and another is for CT, and the special link encodes a context term which penalizes the difference of the tumor segmentation on the two modalities. To fully utilize the characteristics of PET and CT images, a novel energy representation is devised. For the PET, a downhill cost and a 3D derivative cost are proposed. For the CT, a shape penalty cost is integrated into the energy function which helps to constrain the tumor region during the segmentation. We validate our algorithm on a data set which consists of 18 PET-CT images. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the graph cut method solely using the PET or CT is more accurate compared with the random walk method, random walk co-segmentation method, and non-improved graph cut method.},

abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

In this study, we introduce the first use of federated learning for multi-institutional collaboration, enabling deep learning modeling without sharing patient data. Our quantitative results demonstrate that the performance of federated semantic segmentation models (Dice = 0.852) on multimodal brain scans is similar to that of models trained by sharing data (Dice = 0.862).

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

However, as the number of tasks grows, storing and retraining on such data becomes infeasible. A new problem arises where we add new capabilities to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but the training data for its existing capabilities are unavailable. We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace fine-tuning with similar old and new task datasets for improved new task performance.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

We then use these tasks to systematically compare and contrast existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architectures with our new memory-based DRL architectures. These tasks are designed to emphasize, in a controllable manner, issues that pose challenges for RL methods including partial observability (due to first-person visual observations), delayed rewards, high-dimensional visual observations, and the need to use active perception in a correct manner so as to perform well in the tasks. While these tasks are conceptually simple to describe, by virtue of having all of these challenges simultaneously they are difficult for current DRL architectures. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization performance of the architectures on environments not used during training. The experimental results show that our new architectures generalize to unseen environments better than existing DRL architectures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Current computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for contrast-enhanced breast MRI rely on both spatial information obtained from the early-phase and temporal information obtained from the late-phase of the contrast enhancement. However, late-phase information might not be available in a screening setting, such as in abbreviated MRI protocols, where acquisition is limited to early-phase scans. We used deep learning to develop a CADe system that exploits the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans. This system uses three-dimensional (3-D) morphological information in the candidate locations and the symmetry information arising from the enhancement differences of the two breasts. We compared the proposed system to a previously developed system, which uses the full dynamic breast MRI protocol. For training and testing, we used 385 MRI scans, containing 161 malignant lesions. Performance was measured by averaging the sensitivity values between 1/8 - eight false positives. In our experiments, the proposed system obtained a significantly (p=0.008) higher average sensitivity (0.6429±0.0537) compared with that of the previous CADe system (0.5325±0.0547). In conclusion, we developed a CADe system that is able to exploit the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans and can be used in screening programs where abbreviated MRI protocols are used.},

This family includes and generalizes first-order MAML, an approximation to MAML obtained by ignoring second-order derivatives. It also includes Reptile, a new algorithm that we introduce here, which works by repeatedly sampling a task, training on it, and moving the initialization towards the trained weights on that task.

In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial examples are capable of manipulating deep learning systems across three clinical domains. For each of our representative medical deep learning classifiers, both white and black box attacks were highly successful. Our models are representative of the current state of the art in medical computer vision and, in some cases, directly reflect architectures already seeing deployment in real world clinical settings. In addition to the technical contribution of our paper, we synthesize a large body of knowledge about the healthcare system to argue that medicine may be uniquely susceptible to adversarial attacks, both in terms of monetary incentives and technical vulnerability. To this end, we outline the healthcare economy and the incentives it creates for fraud and provide concrete examples of how and why such attacks could be realistically carried out. We urge practitioners to be aware of current vulnerabilities when deploying deep learning systems in clinical settings, and encourage the machine learning community to further investigate the domain-specific characteristics of medical learning systems.},

In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hope artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. In this paper, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images and provides the probability of infection to rapidly detect COVID-19 pneumonia. The proposed system which consists of classification and segmentation will save about 30{\%}–40{\%} of the detection time for physicians and promote the performance of COVID-19 detection. Specifically, working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and/or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we are able to overcome a series of challenges (e.g. data discrepancy, testing time-effectiveness of model, data security, etc.) in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. In addition, since the proposed AI system provides the priority of each CT image with probability of infection, the physicians can confirm and segregate the infected patients in time. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we are able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {Algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis of dementia based on structural MRI have demonstrated high performance in the literature, but are difficult to compare as different data sets and methodology were used for evaluation. In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n. =. 30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0{\%} and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8{\%}. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity.

In this paper, we build a two-stage detection pipeline that is accurate, computationally efficient, robust to variations in PE types and kernels used for CT reconstruction, and most importantly, does not require dense annotations. Given the challenges in acquiring expert annotations in large-scale datasets, our approach produces state-of-the-art results with very sparse emboli contours (at 10mm slice spacing), while using models with significantly lower number of parameters. We achieve AUC scores of 0.94 on the validation set and 0.85 on the test set of highly severe PEs. Using a large, real-world dataset characterized by complex PE types and patients from multiple hospitals, we present an elaborate empirical study and provide guidelines for designing highly generalizable pipelines.},

Microscopic analysis of a biopsy remains one of the most important methods to diagnose the type of breast cancer.

The relevance and potential of automatic classification algorithms using hematoxylin-eosin stained histopathological images has already been demonstrated, but the reported results are still sub-optimal for clinical use. With the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in automatic classification, the Grand Challenge on BreAst Cancer Histology images (BACH) was organized in conjunction with the 15th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition (ICIAR 2018). BACH aimed at the classification and localization of clinically relevant histopathological classes in microscopy and whole-slide images from a large annotated dataset, specifically compiled and made publicly available for the challenge. Following a positive response from the scientific community, a total of 64 submissions, out of 677 registrations, effectively entered the competition. The submitted algorithms improved the state-of-the-art in automatic classification of breast cancer with microscopy images to an accuracy of 87{\%}. Convolutional neuronal networks were the most successful methodology in the BACH challenge. Detailed analysis of the collective results allowed the identification of remaining challenges in the field and recommendations for future developments. The BACH dataset remains publicly available as to promote further improvements to the field of automatic classification in digital pathology.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) images have been widely used in clinical practice for radiotherapy treatment planning of the radiotherapy. Many existing segmentation approaches only work for a single imaging modality, which suffer from the low spatial resolution in PET or low contrast in CT. In this work, we propose a novel method for the co-segmentation of the tumor in both PET and CT images, which makes use of advantages from each modality: the functionality information from PET and the anatomical structure information from CT. The approach formulates the segmentation problem as a minimization problem of a Markov random field model, which encodes the information from both modalities. The optimization is solved using a graph-cut based method. Two sub-graphs are constructed for the segmentation of the PET and the CT images, respectively. To achieve consistent results in two modalities, an adaptive context cost is enforced by adding context arcs between the two sub-graphs. An optimal solution can be obtained by solving a single maximum flow problem, which leads to simultaneous segmentation of the tumor volumes in both modalities. The proposed algorithm was validated in robust delineation of lung tumors on 23 PET-CT datasets and two head-and-neck cancer subjects. Both qualitative and quantitative results show significant improvement compared to the graph cut methods solely using PET or CT. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose: To identify prognostic imaging biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by means of a radiogenomics strategy that integrates gene expression and medical images in patients for whom survival outcomes are not available by leveraging survival data in public gene expression data sets. Materials and Methods: A radiogenomics strategy for associating image features with clusters of coexpressed genes (metagenes) was defined. First, a radiogenomics correlation map is created for a pairwise association between image features and metagenes. Next, predictive models of metagenes are built in terms of image features by using sparse linear regression. Similarly, predictive models of image features are built in terms of metagenes. Finally, the prognostic significance of the predicted image features are evaluated in a public gene expression data set with survival outcomes. This radiogenomics strategy was applied to a cohort of 26 patients with NSCLC for whom gene expression and 180 image features from computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT were available. Results: There were 243 statistically significant pairwise correlations between image features and metagenes of NSCLC. Metagenes were predicted in terms of image features with an accuracy of 59{\%}-83{\%}. One hundred fourteen of 180 CT image features and the PET standardized uptake value were predicted in terms of metagenes with an accuracy of 65{\%}-86{\%}. When the predicted image features were mapped to a public gene expression data set with survival outcomes, tumor size, edge shape, and sharpness ranked highest for prognostic significance. Conclusion: This radiogenomics strategy for identifying imaging biomarkers may enable a more rapid evaluation of novel imaging modalities, thereby accelerating their translation to personalized medicine. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2012.},

abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (which we call the 'NASNet search space') which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or 'cell') on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, which we name a 'NASNet architecture'. We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, a NASNet found by our method achieves 2.4{\%} error rate, which is state-of-the-art. Although the cell is not searched for directly on ImageNet, a NASNet constructed from the best cell achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7{\%} top-1 and 96.2{\%} top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2{\%} better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28{\%} in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74{\%} top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1{\%} better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the image features learned from image classification are generically useful and can be transferred to other computer vision problems. On the task of object detection, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0{\%} achieving 43.1{\%} mAP on the COCO dataset.},

However, there are many tasks for which conventional control engineering methods are not directly applicable because there is not enough information about how the system should be controlled (i.e. reinforcement learning problems). In this paper, we explore an approach to such problems that evolves fast-weight neural networks. These networks, although capable of implementing arbitrary non-linear mappings, can more easily exploit the piecewise linearity inherent in most systems, in order to produce simpler and more comprehensible controllers. The method is tested on 2D mobile robot version of the pole balancing task where the controller must learn to switch between two operating modes, one using a single pole and the other using a jointed pole version that has not before been solved. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract = {Tumor segmentation in whole-slide images of histology slides is an important step towards computer-assisted diagnosis. In this work, we propose a tumor segmentation framework based on the novel concept of persistent homology profiles (PHPs). For a given image patch, the homology profiles are derived by efficient computation of persistent homology, which is an algebraic tool from homology theory. We propose an efficient way of computing topological persistence of an image, alternative to simplicial homology. The PHPs are devised to distinguish tumor regions from their normal counterparts by modeling the atypical characteristics of tumor nuclei. We propose two variants of our method for tumor segmentation: one that targets speed without compromising accuracy and the other that targets higher accuracy. The fast version is based on a selection of exemplar image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) and patch classification by quantifying the divergence between the PHPs of exemplars and the input image patch. Detailed comparative evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than competing algorithms while achieving comparable results. The accurate version combines the PHPs and high-level CNN features and employs a multi-stage ensemble strategy for image patch labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of PHPs and CNN features outperform competing algorithms. This study is performed on two independently collected colorectal datasets containing adenoma, adenocarcinoma, signet, and healthy cases. Collectively, the accurate tumor segmentation produces the highest average patch-level F1-score, as compared with competing algorithms, on malignant and healthy cases from both the datasets. Overall the proposed framework highlights the utility of persistent homology for histopathology image analysis.},

abstract = {Brain tumor is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death globally among children and adults. Precise classification of brain tumor grade (low-grade and high-grade glioma) at early stage plays a key role in successful prognosis and treatment planning. With recent advances in deep learning, Artificial Intelligence-enabled brain tumor grading systems can assist radiologists in the interpretation of medical images within seconds. The performance of deep learning techniques is, however, highly depended on the size of the annotated dataset. It is extremely challenging to label a large quantity of medical images given the complexity and volume of medical data. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning based active learning framework to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining stability and robustness of the model performance for brain tumor classification. We employed a 2D slice-based approach to train and finetune our model on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) training dataset of 203 patients and a validation dataset of 66 patients which was used as the baseline. With our proposed method, the model achieved Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of 82.89{\%} on a separate test dataset of 66 patients, which was 2.92{\%} higher than the baseline AUC while saving at least 40{\%} of labeling cost. In order to further examine the robustness of our method, we created a balanced dataset, which underwent the same procedure. The model achieved AUC of 82{\%} compared with AUC of 78.48{\%} for the baseline, which reassures the robustness and stability of our proposed transfer learning augmented with active learning framework while significantly reducing the size of training data.},

abstract = {In the last decades, large datasets of fundus photographs have been collected in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these datasets were used to train automatic detectors for DR and a few other frequent pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits the adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions that ophthalmologists currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The reason is that standard deep learning requires too many examples of these conditions. However, this limitation can be addressed with few-shot learning, a machine learning paradigm where a classifier has to generalize to a new category not seen in training, given only a few examples of this category. This paper presents a new few-shot learning framework that extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for frequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare condition detection. It is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive photographs containing the same anomalies as similar, even though these CNNs were trained to detect unrelated conditions. This observation was based on the t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our probabilistic model. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 screening examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network show that 37 conditions, out of 41, can be detected with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938). In particular, this framework significantly outperforms other frameworks for detecting rare conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and Siamese networks, another few-shot learning solution. We expect these richer predictions to trigger the adoption of automated eye pathology screening, which will revolutionize clinical practice in ophthalmology.},

abstract = {Detecting early infarct (EI) plays an essential role in patient selection for reperfusion therapy in the management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). EI volume at acute or hyper-acute stage can be measured using advanced pre-treatment imaging, such as MRI and CT perfusion. In this study, a novel multi-task learning approach, EIS-Net, is proposed to segment EI and score Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) simultaneously on baseline non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans of AIS patients. The EIS-Net comprises of a 3D triplet convolutional neural network (T-CNN) for EI segmentation and a multi-region classification network for ASPECTS scoring. T-CNN has triple encoders with original NCCT, mirrored NCCT, and atlas as inputs, as well as one decoder. A comparison disparity block (CDB) is designed to extract and enhance image contexts. In the decoder, a multi-level attention gate module (MAGM) is developed to recalibrate the features of the decoder for both segmentation and classification tasks. Evaluations using a high-quality dataset comprising of baseline NCCT and concomitant diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) as reference standard of 260 patients with AIS show that the proposed EIS-Net can accurately segment EI. The EIS-Net segmented EI volume strongly correlates with EI volume on DWI (r=0.919), and the mean difference between the two volumes is 8.5 mL. For ASPECTS scoring, the proposed EIS-Net achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.78 for total 10-point ASPECTS and a kappa of 0.75 for dichotomized ASPECTS (≤ 4 vs. {\textgreater}4). Both EI segmentation and ASPECTS scoring tasks achieve state-of-the-art performances.},

abstract = {A longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3D shapes for recognition: should 3D shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes' rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.},

abstract = {Developing new deep learning methods for medical image analysis is a prevalent research topic in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning scheme with a novel loss function for weakly supervised breast cancer diagnosis. According to the Nottingham Grading System, mitotic count plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis and grading. To determine the cancer grade, pathologists usually need to manually count mitosis from a great deal of histopathology images, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This paper proposes an automatic method for detecting mitosis. We regard the mitosis detection task as a semantic segmentation problem and use a deep fully convolutional network to address it. Different from conventional training data used in semantic segmentation system, the training label of mitosis data is usually in the format of centroid pixel, rather than all the pixels belonging to a mitosis. The centroid label is a kind of weak label, which is much easier to annotate and can save the effort of pathologists a lot. However, technically this weak label is not sufficient for training a mitosis segmentation model. To tackle this problem, we expand the single-pixel label to a novel label with concentric circles, where the inside circle is a mitotic region and the ring around the inside circle is a “middle ground”. During the training stage, we do not compute the loss of the ring region because it may have the presence of both mitotic and non-mitotic pixels. This new loss termed as “concentric loss” is able to make the semantic segmentation network be trained with the weakly annotated mitosis data. On the generated segmentation map from the segmentation model, we filter out low confidence and obtain mitotic cells. On the challenging ICPR 2014 MITOSIS dataset and AMIDA13 dataset, we achieve a 0.562 F-score and 0.673 F-score respectively, outperforming all previous approaches significantly. On the latest TUPAC16 dataset, we obtain a F-score of 0.669, which is also the state-of-the-art result. The excellent results quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mitosis segmentation network with the concentric loss. All of our code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/ChaoLi977/SegMitos{\_}mitosis{\_}detection.},

Especially helpful (and entertaining) is the chapter on the writing process. Anyone who has spent more time avoiding a writing task than actually doing it will appreciate Alley's tips." -Dr. Ellen Ochoa, Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations, Johnson Space Center.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method (Fast R-CNN) for object detection. Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate. Fast R-CNN is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn.},

abstract = {In this work, we revisit atrous convolution, a powerful tool to explicitly adjust filter's field-of-view as well as control the resolution of feature responses computed by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, in the application of semantic image segmentation. To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.},

abstract = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of avoidable vision loss, predominantly affecting the working-age population across the globe. Screening for DR, coupled with timely consultation and treatment, is a globally trusted policy to avoid vision loss. However, implementation of DR screening programs is challenging due to the scarcity of medical professionals able to screen a growing global diabetic population at risk for DR. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in retinal image analysis could provide a sustainable approach for such large-scale screening effort. The recent scientific advances in computing capacity and machine learning approaches provide an avenue for biomedical scientists to reach this goal. Aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic DR diagnosis, a grand challenge on “Diabetic Retinopathy – Segmentation and Grading” was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI - 2018). In this paper, we report the set-up and results of this challenge that is primarily based on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD). There were three principal sub-challenges: lesion segmentation, disease severity grading, and localization of retinal landmarks and segmentation. These multiple tasks in this challenge allow to test the generalizability of algorithms, and this is what makes it different from existing ones. It received a positive response from the scientific community with 148 submissions from 495 registrations effectively entered in this challenge. This paper outlines the challenge, its organization, the dataset used, evaluation methods and results of top-performing participating solutions. The top-performing approaches utilized a blend of clinical information, data augmentation, and an ensemble of models. These findings have the potential to enable new developments in retinal image analysis and image-based DR screening in particular.},

However, public mitochondria segmentation datasets only contain hundreds of instances with simple shapes. It is unclear if existing methods achieving human-level accuracy on these small datasets are robust in practice. To this end, we introduce the MitoEM dataset, a 3D mitochondria instance segmentation dataset with two (30 $\mu$ m)3 volumes from human and rat cortices respectively, 3,600× larger than previous benchmarks. With around 40K instances, we find a great diversity of mitochondria in terms of shape and density. For evaluation, we tailor the implementation of the average precision (AP) metric for 3D data with a 45× speedup. On MitoEM, we find existing instance segmentation methods often fail to correctly segment mitochondria with complex shapes or close contacts with other instances. Thus, our MitoEM dataset poses new challenges to the field. We release our code and data: https://donglaiw.github.io/page/mitoEM/index.html.},

abstract = {Deep networks have recently enjoyed enormous success when applied to recognition and classification problems in computer vision [22, 33], but their use in graphics problems has been limited ([23, 7] are notable recent exceptions). In this work, we present a novel deep architecture that performs new view synthesis directly from pixels, trained from a large number of posed image sets. In contrast to traditional approaches, which consist of multiple complex stages of processing, each of which requires careful tuning and can fail in unexpected ways, our system is trained end-to-end. The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the network, which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The benefits of our approach include generality (we only require posed image sets and can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results on traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end nature of our system, which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to color, depth, and texture priors learnt automatically from the training data. We show view interpolation results on imagery from the KITTI dataset [12], from data from [1] as well as on Google Street View images. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep learning to the problem of new view synthesis from sets of real-world, natural imagery.},

abstract = {There is a large variety of trackers, which have been proposed in the literature during the last two decades with some mixed success. Object tracking in realistic scenarios is a difficult problem, therefore, it remains a most active area of research in computer vision. A good tracker should perform well in a large number of videos involving illumination changes, occlusion, clutter, camera motion, low contrast, specularities, and at least six more aspects. However, the performance of proposed trackers have been evaluated typically on less than ten videos, or on the special purpose datasets. In this paper, we aim to evaluate trackers systematically and experimentally on 315 video fragments covering above aspects. We selected a set of nineteen trackers to include a wide variety of algorithms often cited in literature, supplemented with trackers appearing in 2010 and 2011 for which the code was publicly available. We demonstrate that trackers can be evaluated objectively by survival curves, Kaplan Meier statistics, and Grubs testing. We find that in the evaluation practice the F-score is as effective as the object tracking accuracy (OTA) score. The analysis under a large variety of circumstances provides objective insight into the strengths and weaknesses of trackers. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

The automatic delineation of myocardium is however challenging due to the heterogeneous intensity distributions and indistinct boundaries in the images. In this work,we present a multivariate mixture model (MvMM) for text classification,which combines the complementary information from multi-sequence (MS) cardiac MRI and perform the segmentation of them simultaneously. The expectation maximization (EM) method is adopted to estimate the segmentation and model parameters from the log-likelihood (LL) of the mixture model,where a probabilistic atlas is used for initialization. Furthermore,to correct the intra- and inter-image misalignments,we formulate the MvMM with transformations,which are embedded into the LL framework and thus can be optimized by the iterative conditional mode approach. We applied MvMM for segmentation of eighteen subjects with three sequences and obtained promising results. We compared with two conventional methods,and the improvements of segmentation performance on LE and T2 MRI were evident and statistically significant by MvMM.},

abstract = {This paper describes a framework for establishing a reference airway tree segmentation, which was used to quantitatively evaluate 15 different airway tree extraction algorithms in a standardized manner. Because of the sheer difficulty involved in manually constructing a complete reference standard from scratch, we propose to construct the reference using results from all algorithms that are to be evaluated. We start by subdividing each segmented airway tree into its individual branch segments. Each branch segment is then visually scored by trained observers to determine whether or not it is a correctly segmented part of the airway tree. Finally, the reference airway trees are constructed by taking the union of all correctly extracted branch segments. Fifteen airway tree extraction algorithms from different research groups are evaluated on a diverse set of 20 chest computed tomography (CT) scans of subjects ranging from healthy volunteers to patients with severe pathologies, scanned at different sites, with different CT scanner brands, models, and scanning protocols. Three performance measures covering different aspects of segmentation quality were computed for all participating algorithms. Results from the evaluation showed that no single algorithm could extract more than an average of 74{\%} of the total length of all branches in the reference standard, indicating substantial differences between the algorithms. A fusion scheme that obtained superior results is presented, demonstrating that there is complementary information provided by the different algorithms and there is still room for further improvements in airway segmentation algorithms. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease, and its diagnosis, treatment, and study relies on non-invasive imaging. Algorithms for stroke lesion segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes are intensely researched, but the reported results are largely incomparable due to different datasets and evaluation schemes. We approached this urgent problem of comparability with the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2015 conference. In this paper we propose a common evaluation framework, describe the publicly available datasets, and present the results of the two sub-challenges: Sub-Acute Stroke Lesion Segmentation (SISS) and Stroke Perfusion Estimation (SPES). A total of 16 research groups participated with a wide range of state-of-the-art automatic segmentation algorithms. A thorough analysis of the obtained data enables a critical evaluation of the current state-of-the-art, recommendations for further developments, and the identification of remaining challenges. The segmentation of acute perfusion lesions addressed in SPES was found to be feasible. However, algorithms applied to sub-acute lesion segmentation in SISS still lack accuracy. Overall, no algorithmic characteristic of any method was found to perform superior to the others. Instead, the characteristics of stroke lesion appearances, their evolution, and the observed challenges should be studied in detail. The annotated ISLES image datasets continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system to serve as an ongoing benchmarking resource (www.isles-challenge.org).},

abstract = {In this study, we propose a novel anomaly detection model targeting subtle brain lesions in multiparametric MRI. To compensate for the lack of annotated data adequately sampling the heterogeneity of such pathologies, we cast this problem as an outlier detection problem and introduce a novel configuration of unsupervised deep siamese networks to learn normal brain representations using a series of non-pathological brain scans. The proposed siamese network, composed of stacked convolutional autoencoders as subnetworks is designed to map patches extracted from healthy control scans only and centered at the same spatial localization to ‘close' representations with respect to the chosen metric in a latent space. It is based on a novel loss function combining a similarity term and a regularization term compensating for the lack of dissimilar pairs. These latent representations are then fed into oc-SVM models at voxel-level to produce anomaly score maps. We evaluate the performance of our brain anomaly detection model to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in multiparametric (T1-weighted, FLAIR) MRI exams considered as normal (MRI-negative). Our detection model trained on 75 healthy subjects and validated on 21 epilepsy patients (with 18 MRI-negatives) achieves a maximum sensitivity of 61{\%} on the MRI-negative lesions, identified among the 5 most suspicious detections on average. It is shown to outperform detection models based on the same architecture but with stacked convolutional or Wasserstein autoencoders as unsupervised feature extraction mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background Accurately predicting the survival rate of breast cancer patients is a major issue for cancer researchers. Machine learning (ML) has attracted much attention with the hope that it could provide accurate results, but its modeling methods and prediction performance remain controversial. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and critically appraise current studies regarding the application of ML in predicting the 5-year survival rate of breast cancer. Methods In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, two researchers independently searched the PubMed (including MEDLINE), Embase, and Web of Science Core databases from inception to November 30, 2020. The search terms included breast neoplasms, survival, machine learning, and specific algorithm names. The included studies related to the use of ML to build a breast cancer survival prediction model and model performance that can be measured with the value of said verification results. The excluded studies in which the modeling process were not explained clearly and had incomplete information. The extracted information included literature information, database information, data preparation and modeling process information, model construction and performance evaluation information, and candidate predictor information. Results Thirty-one studies that met the inclusion criteria were included, most of which were published after 2013. The most frequently used ML methods were decision trees (19 studies, 61.3{\%}), artificial neural networks (18 studies, 58.1{\%}), support vector machines (16 studies, 51.6{\%}), and ensemble learning (10 studies, 32.3{\%}). The median sample size was 37256 (range 200 to 659820) patients, and the median predictor was 16 (range 3 to 625). The accuracy of 29 studies ranged from 0.510 to 0.971. The sensitivity of 25 studies ranged from 0.037 to 1. The specificity of 24 studies ranged from 0.008 to 0.993. The AUC of 20 studies ranged from 0.500 to 0.972. The precision of 6 studies ranged from 0.549 to 1. All of the models were internally validated, and only one was externally validated. Conclusions Overall, compared with traditional statistical methods, the performance of ML models does not necessarily show any improvement, and this area of research still faces limitations related to a lack of data preprocessing steps, the excessive differences of sample feature selection, and issues related to validation. Further optimization of the performance of the proposed model is also needed in the future, which requires more standardization and subsequent validation.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks have achieved prominent success on a variety of medical imaging tasks when a large amount of labeled training data is available. However, the acquisition of expert annotations for medical data is usually expensive and time-consuming, which poses a great challenge for supervised learning approaches. In this work, we proposed a novel semi-supervised deep learning method, i.e., deep virtual adversarial self-training with consistency regularization, for large-scale medical image classification. To effectively exploit useful information from unlabeled data, we leverage self-training and consistency regularization to harness the underlying knowledge, which helps improve the discrimination capability of training models. More concretely, the model first uses its prediction for pseudo-labeling on the weakly-augmented input image. A pseudo-label is kept only if the corresponding class probability is of high confidence. Then the model prediction is encouraged to be consistent with the strongly-augmented version of the same input image. To improve the robustness of the network against virtual adversarial perturbed input, we incorporate virtual adversarial training (VAT) on both labeled and unlabeled data into the course of training. Hence, the network is trained by minimizing a combination of three types of losses, including a standard supervised loss on labeled data, a consistency regularization loss on unlabeled data, and a VAT loss on both labeled and labeled data. We extensively evaluate the proposed semi-supervised deep learning methods on two challenging medical image classification tasks: breast cancer screening from ultrasound images and multi-class ophthalmic disease classification from optical coherence tomography B-scan images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both supervised baseline and other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on all tasks.},

Early diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) chest scans provides an opportunity for designing effective treatment and making financial and care plans. In this paper, we consider the problem of diagnostic classification between benign and malignant lung nodules in CT images, which aims to learn a direct mapping from 3D images to class labels. To achieve this goal, four two-pathway Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are proposed, including a basic 3D CNN, a novel multi-output network, a 3D DenseNet, and an augmented 3D DenseNet with multi-outputs. These four networks are evaluated on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset and outperform most existing methods. In particular, the 3D multi-output DenseNet (MoDenseNet) achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the task of end-to-end lung nodule diagnosis. In addition, the networks pretrained on the LIDC-IDRI dataset can be further extended to handle smaller datasets using transfer learning. This is demonstrated on our dataset with encouraging prediction accuracy in lung nodule classification.},

abstract = {Though conventional coronary angiography (CCA) has been the standard of reference for diagnosing coronary artery disease in the past decades, computed tomography angiography (CTA) has rapidly emerged, and is nowadays widely used in clinical practice. Here, we introduce a standardized evaluation framework to reliably evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms devised to detect and quantify the coronary artery stenoses, and to segment the coronary artery lumen in CTA data. The objective of this evaluation framework is to demonstrate the feasibility of dedicated algorithms to: (1) (semi-)automatically detect and quantify stenosis on CTA, in comparison with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and CTA consensus reading, and (2) (semi-)automatically segment the coronary lumen on CTA, in comparison with expert's manual annotation. A database consisting of 48 multicenter multivendor cardiac CTA datasets with corresponding reference standards are described and made available. The algorithms from 11 research groups were quantitatively evaluated and compared. The results show that (1) some of the current stenosis detection/quantification algorithms may be used for triage or as a second-reader in clinical practice, and that (2) automatic lumen segmentation is possible with a precision similar to that obtained by experts.

abstract = {The mental contents of perception and imagery are thought to be encoded in hierarchical representations in the brain, but previous attempts to visualize perceptual contents have failed to capitalize on multiple levels of the hierarchy, leaving it challenging to reconstruct internal imagery. Recent work showed that visual cortical activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be decoded (translated) into the hierarchical features of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features. Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that our method was able to reliably produce reconstructions that resembled the viewed natural images. A natural image prior introduced by a deep generator neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to the reconstructions. Human judgment of the reconstructions supported the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance the visual quality of generated images. While our model was solely trained with natural images, it successfully generalized to artificial shapes, indicating that our model was not simply matching to exemplars. The same analysis applied to mental imagery demonstrated rudimentary reconstructions of the subjective content. Our results suggest that our method can effectively combine hierarchical neural representations to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images, providing a new window into the internal contents of the brain.},

Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training the perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better performance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.},

abstract = {Humans make accurate decisions by interpreting complex data from multiple sources. Medical diagnostics, in particular, often hinge on human interpretation of multimodal information. In order for artificial intelligence to make progress in automated, objective, and accurate diagnosis and prognosis, methods to fuse information from multiple medical imaging modalities are required. However, combining information from multiple data sources has several challenges, as current deep learning architectures lack the ability to extract useful representations from multimodal information, and often simple concatenation is used to fuse such information. In this work, we propose Multimodal DenseNet, a novel architecture for fusing multimodal data. Instead of focusing on concatenation or early and late fusion, our proposed architectures fuses information over several layers and gives the model flexibility in how it combines information from multiple sources. We apply this architecture to the challenge of polyp characterization and landmark identification in endoscopy. Features from white light images are fused with features from narrow band imaging or depth maps. This study demonstrates that Multimodal DenseNet outperforms monomodal classification as well as other multimodal fusion techniques by a significant margin on two different datasets.},

Artefacts often affect the robustness of deep learning methods applied to the gastrointestinal tract organs as they can be confused with tissue of interest. EndoCV2020 challenges are designed to address research questions in these remits.

The out-of-sample generalization ability of detection algorithms was also evaluated. Whilst most teams focused on accuracy improvements, only a few methods hold credibility for clinical usability.

These biomarkers are commonly used in high-content drug screening to analyze drug response. The main contribution of the proposed work is the automatic generation of three fluorescence images from a conventional bright-field image; this can greatly reduce the time-consuming and laborious tissue preparation process and improve throughput of the screening process. Our proposed method uses only a single bright-field image and the corresponding fluorescence images as a set of image pairs for training an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network. By leveraging deep convolutional neural networks with a set of image pairs of bright-field and corresponding fluorescence images, our proposed method can produce synthetic fluorescence images comparable to real fluorescence microscopy images with high accuracy. Our proposed model uses multi-task learning with adversarial losses to generate more accurate and realistic microscopy images. We assess the efficacy of the proposed method using real bright-field and fluorescence microscopy image datasets from patient-driven samples of a glioblastoma, and validate the method's accuracy with various quality metrics including cell number correlation (CNC), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), cell viability correlation (CVC), error maps, and R2 correlation.},

Segmentation and classification of histology tissue in H{\&}E stained tumor image datasets is a challenging task because of intra-class variations, inter-class similarity, crowded context, and noisy data. In recent years, deep learning approaches have led to encouraging results in breast cancer and prostate cancer analysis. In this article, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) as a tool to improve efficiency and accuracy of osteosarcoma tumor classification into tumor classes (viable tumor, necrosis) versus nontumor. The proposed CNN architecture contains eight learned layers: three sets of stacked two convolutional layers interspersed with max pooling layers for feature extraction and two fully connected layers with data augmentation strategies to boost performance. The use of a neural network results in higher accuracy of average 92{\%} for the classification. We compare the proposed architecture with three existing and proven CNN architectures for image classification: AlexNet, LeNet, and VGGNet. We also provide a pipeline to calculate percentage necrosis in a given whole slide image. We conclude that the use of neural networks can assure both high accuracy and efficiency in osteosarcoma classification.},

The obtained classification accuracy resulted in a first place in the challenge, and the method was significantly better (McNemar's test) than the bottom 24 methods out of the total of 29 methods contributed by 15 different teams in the challenge. The method was further investigated with learning curve and feature selection experiments using ADNI and AIBL data. The learning curve experiments suggested that neither more training data nor a more complex classifier would have improved the obtained results. The feature selection experiment showed that both common and uncommon individual MRI biomarkers contributed to the performance; hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, hippocampal texture, and parietal lobe thickness were the most important. This study highlights the need for both subtle, localized measurements and global measurements in order to discriminate NC, MCI, and AD simultaneously based on a single structural MRI scan. It is likely that additional non-structural MRI features are needed to further improve the obtained performance, especially to improve the discrimination between NC and MCI.},

abstract = {Segmentation of abdominal organs has been a comprehensive, yet unresolved, research field for many years. In the last decade, intensive developments in deep learning (DL) introduced new state-of-the-art segmentation systems. Despite outperforming the overall accuracy of existing systems, the effects of DL model properties and parameters on the performance are hard to interpret. This makes comparative analysis a necessary tool towards interpretable studies and systems. Moreover, the performance of DL for emerging learning approaches such as cross-modality and multi-modal semantic segmentation tasks has been rarely discussed. In order to expand the knowledge on these topics, the CHAOS – Combined (CT-MR) Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation challenge was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2019, in Venice, Italy. Abdominal organ segmentation from routine acquisitions plays an important role in several clinical applications, such as pre-surgical planning or morphological and volumetric follow-ups for various diseases. These applications require a certain level of performance on a diverse set of metrics such as maximum symmetric surface distance (MSSD) to determine surgical error-margin or overlap errors for tracking size and shape differences. Previous abdomen related challenges are mainly focused on tumor/lesion detection and/or classification with a single modality. Conversely, CHAOS provides both abdominal CT and MR data from healthy subjects for single and multiple abdominal organ segmentation. Five different but complementary tasks were designed to analyze the capabilities of participating approaches from multiple perspectives. The results were investigated thoroughly, compared with manual annotations and interactive methods. The analysis shows that the performance of DL models for single modality (CT / MR) can show reliable volumetric analysis performance (DICE: 0.98 ± 0.00 / 0.95 ± 0.01), but the best MSSD performance remains limited (21.89 ± 13.94 / 20.85 ± 10.63 mm). The performances of participating models decrease dramatically for cross-modality tasks both for the liver (DICE: 0.88 ± 0.15 MSSD: 36.33 ± 21.97 mm). Despite contrary examples on different applications, multi-tasking DL models designed to segment all organs are observed to perform worse compared to organ-specific ones (performance drop around 5{\%}). Nevertheless, some of the successful models show better performance with their multi-organ versions. We conclude that the exploration of those pros and cons in both single vs multi-organ and cross-modality segmentations is poised to have an impact on further research for developing effective algorithms that would support real-world clinical applications. Finally, having more than 1500 participants and receiving more than 550 submissions, another important contribution of this study is the analysis on shortcomings of challenge organizations such as the effects of multiple submissions and peeking phenomenon.},

abstract = {Understanding 3D object structure from a single image is an important but difficult task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object annotations in real images. Previous work tackles this problem by either solving an optimization task given 2D keypoint positions, or training on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D INterpreter Network (3D-INN), an endto-end framework which sequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object structure, trained on both real 2D-annotated images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two technic al innovations.First, we propose a Projection Layer, which projects estimated 3D structure to 2D space, so that 3D-INN can be trained to predict 3D structural parameters supervised by 2D annotations on real images. Second, heatmaps of keypoints serve as an intermediate representation connecting real and synthetic data, enabling 3D-INN to benefit from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the difference between the statistics of real and synthesized images due to imperfect rendering. The network achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D keypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery. We also show that the recovered 3D information can be used in other vision applications, such as image retrieval.},

abstract = {The deviation from pure Brownian motion, generally referred to as anomalous diffusion, has received large attention in the scientific literature to describe many physical scenarios. Several methods, based on classical statistics and machine learning approaches, have been developed to characterize anomalous diffusion from experimental data, which are usually acquired as particle trajectories. With the aim to assess and compare the available methods to characterize anomalous diffusion, we have organized the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge (http://www.andi-challenge.org/). Specifically, the AnDi Challenge will address three different aspects of anomalous diffusion characterization, namely: (i) Inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent. (ii) Identification of the underlying diffusion model. (iii) Segmentation of trajectories. Each problem includes sub-tasks for different number of dimensions (1D, 2D and 3D). In order to compare the various methods, we have developed a dedicated open-source framework for the simulation of the anomalous diffusion trajectories that are used for the training and test datasets. The challenge was launched on March 1, 2020, and consists of three phases. Currently, the participation to the first phase is open. Submissions will be automatically evaluated and the performance of the top-scoring methods will be thoroughly analyzed and compared in an upcoming article.},

abstract = {Purpose : Lung cancer has the highest death rate among all cancers in the USA. In this work we focus on improving the ability of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to predict the malignancy of nodules from cropped CT images of lung nodules. Methods: We evaluate the effectiveness of very deep convolutional neural networks at the task of expert-level lung nodule malignancy classification. Using the state-of-the-art ResNet architecture as our basis, we explore the effect of curriculum learning, transfer learning, and varying network depth on the accuracy of malignancy classification. Results: Due to a lack of public datasets with standardized problem definitions and train/test splits, studies in this area tend to not compare directly against other existing work. This makes it hard to know the relative improvement in the new solution. In contrast, we directly compare our system against two state-of-the-art deep learning systems for nodule classification on the LIDC/IDRI dataset using the same experimental setup and data set. The results show that our system achieves the highest performance in terms of all metrics measured including sensitivity, specificity, precision, AUROC, and accuracy. Conclusions: The proposed method of combining deep residual learning, curriculum learning, and transfer learning translates to high nodule classification accuracy. This reveals a promising new direction for effective pulmonary nodule CAD systems that mirrors the success of recent deep learning advances in other image-based application domains.},

abstract = {We present a system for covert automated deception detection using information available in a video. We study the importance of different modalities like vision, audio and text for this task. On the vision side, our system uses classifiers trained on low level video features which predict human micro-expressions. We show that predictions of high-level micro-expressions can be used as features for deception prediction. Surprisingly, IDT (Improved Dense Trajectory) features which have been widely used for action recognition, are also very good at predicting deception in videos. We fuse the score of classifiers trained on IDT features and high-level micro-expressions to improve performance. MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features from the audio domain also provide a significant boost in performance, while information from transcripts is not very beneficial for our system. Using various classifiers, our automated system obtains an AUC of 0.877 (10-fold cross-validation) when evaluated on subjects which were not part of the training set. Even though state-of-the-art methods use human annotations of micro-expressions for deception detection, our fully automated approach outperforms them by 5{\%}. When combined with human annotations of micro-expressions, our AUC improves to 0.922.

abstract = {Prostate MRI image segmentation has been an area of intense research due to the increased use of MRI as a modality for the clinical workup of prostate cancer. Segmentation is useful for various tasks, e.g. to accurately localize prostate boundaries for radiotherapy or to initialize multi-modal registration algorithms. In the past, it has been difficult for research groups to evaluate prostate segmentation algorithms on multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-protocol data. Especially because we are dealing with MR images, image appearance, resolution and the presence of artifacts are affected by differences in scanners and/or protocols, which in turn can have a large influence on algorithm accuracy. The Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge was setup to allow a fair and meaningful comparison of segmentation methods on the basis of performance and robustness. In this work we will discuss the initial results of the online PROMISE12 challenge, and the results obtained in the live challenge workshop hosted by the MICCAI2012 conference. In the challenge, 100 prostate MR cases from 4 different centers were included, with differences in scanner manufacturer, field strength and protocol. A total of 11 teams from academic research groups and industry participated. Algorithms showed a wide variety in methods and implementation, including active appearance models, atlas registration and level sets. Evaluation was performed using boundary and volume based metrics which were combined into a single score relating the metrics to human expert performance. The winners of the challenge where the algorithms by teams Imorphics and ScrAutoProstate, with scores of 85.72 and 84.29 overall. Both algorithms where significantly better than all other algorithms in the challenge (p {\textless} 0.05) and had an efficient implementation with a run time of 8. min and 3. s per case respectively. Overall, active appearance model based approaches seemed to outperform other approaches like multi-atlas registration, both on accuracy and computation time. Although average algorithm performance was good to excellent and the Imorphics algorithm outperformed the second observer on average, we showed that algorithm combination might lead to further improvement, indicating that optimal performance for prostate segmentation is not yet obtained.

STUDY DESIGN: An algorithm was developed to deconvolve the color information acquired with red-green-blue (RGB) cameras and to calculate the contribution of each of the applied stains based on stain-specific RGB absorption. The algorithm was tested using different combinations of diaminobenzidine, hematoxylin and eosin at different staining levels. RESULTS: Quantification of the different stains was not significantly influenced by the combination of multiple stains in a single sample. The color deconvolution algorithm resulted in comparable quantification independent of the stain combinations as long as the histochemical procedures did not influence the amount of stain in the sample due to bleaching because of stain solubility and saturation of staining was prevented. CONCLUSION: This image analysis algorithm provides a robust and flexible method for objective immunohistochemical analysis of samples stained with up to three different stains using a laboratory microscope, standard RGB camera setup and the public domain program NIH Image.},

Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74{\%}-85{\%}), illustrating the difficulty of this task.

abstract = {A fundamental problem with few-shot learning is the scarcity of data in training. A natural solution to alleviate this scarcity is to augment the existing images for each training class. However, directly augmenting samples in image space may not necessarily, nor sufficiently, explore the intra-class variation. To this end, we propose to directly synthesize instance features by leveraging the semantics of each class. Essentially, a novel auto-encoder network dual TriNet, is proposed for feature augmentation. The encoder TriNet projects multi-layer visual features of deep CNNs into the semantic space. In this space, data augmentation is induced, and the augmented instance representation is projected back into the image feature spaces by the decoder TriNet. Two data argumentation strategies in the semantic space are explored; notably these seemingly simple augmentations in semantic space result in complex augmented feature distributions in the image feature space, resulting in substantially better performance.

A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the 'Squeeze-and-Excitation' (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251 percent, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of {\$}{\{}\backslashsim {\}}{\$}∼25 percent.

abstract = {Automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans has been an active area of research for the last two decades. However, there have only been few studies that provide a comparative performance evaluation of different systems on a common database. We have therefore set up the LUNA16 challenge, an objective evaluation framework for automatic nodule detection algorithms using the largest publicly available reference database of chest CT scans, the LIDC-IDRI data set. In LUNA16, participants develop their algorithm and upload their predictions on 888 CT scans in one of the two tracks: 1) the complete nodule detection track where a complete CAD system should be developed, or 2) the false positive reduction track where a provided set of nodule candidates should be classified. This paper describes the setup of LUNA16 and presents the results of the challenge so far. Moreover, the impact of combining individual systems on the detection performance was also investigated. It was observed that the leading solutions employed convolutional networks and used the provided set of nodule candidates. The combination of these solutions achieved an excellent sensitivity of over 95{\%} at fewer than 1.0 false positives per scan. This highlights the potential of combining algorithms to improve the detection performance. Our observer study with four expert readers has shown that the best system detects nodules that were missed by expert readers who originally annotated the LIDC-IDRI data. We released this set of additional nodules for further development of CAD systems.},

abstract = {Over the last fifty years behavioral and medical research has been generously supported by the federal government, private foundations, and other philanthropic organizations contributing to the development of a vibrant public health system both in the United States and worldwide. However, these funds are dwindling and to stay competitive, investigators must understand the funding environment and know how to translate their hypotheses into research grant applications that reviewers evaluate as having scientific merit. The Second Edition of How to Write a Successful Research Grant Application is the only book of its kind written by federal research investigators which provides technical assistance for researchers applying for biobehavioral and psychosocial research funding and can give them an edge in this competitive environment. The book provides invaluable tips on all aspects of the art of grantsmanship, including: how to determine research opportunities and priorities, how to develop the different elements of an application, how to negotiate the electronic submission and review processes, and how to disseminate the findings. Charts, visual aids, Web links, an extensive real-world example of a research proposal with budget, and a "So You Were Awarded Your Grant-Now What?" chapter show prospective applicants how to: Formulate a testworthy-and interesting- hypothesis. Select the appropriate research mechanism. Avoid common pitfalls in proposal writing. Develop an adequate control group. Conduct a rigorous qualitative inquiry. Develop a budget justification of costs. Develop a human subjects of animal welfare plan. Write a data analytic plan. Design a quality control/assurance program. Read between the lines of a summary of the review of your application. Although its focus is on Public Health Service funding, How to Write a Successful Research Grant is equally useful for all research proposals, including graduate students preparing a thesis or dissertation proposal. Service providers in community-based organizations and public health agencies will also find this a useful resource in preparing a proposal to compete for grant funds from state and community resources, non-government organizations, and foundations. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

The NeoBrainS12 study (http://neobrains12.isi.uu.nl), providing three different image sets of preterm born infants, was set up to provide such a comparison. These sets are (i) axial scans acquired at 40. weeks corrected age, (ii) coronal scans acquired at 30. weeks corrected age and (iii) coronal scans acquired at 40. weeks corrected age. Each of these three sets consists of three T1- and T2-weighted MR images of the brain acquired with a 3T MRI scanner. The task was to segment cortical grey matter, non-myelinated and myelinated white matter, brainstem, basal ganglia and thalami, cerebellum, and cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and in the extracerebral space separately. Any team could upload the results and all segmentations were evaluated in the same way. This paper presents the results of eight participating teams. The results demonstrate that the participating methods were able to segment all tissue classes well, except myelinated white matter.},

abstract = {Automated medical report generation in spine radiology, i.e., given spinal medical images and directly create radiologist-level diagnosis reports to support clinical decision making, is a novel yet fundamental study in the domain of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, it is incredibly challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge, achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving a comprehensive medical report generation. When employed in a real-world clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on spinal medical report generation and show that our algorithm remarkably exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.},

abstract = {Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides noninvasive evaluation of patient's anatomy without using ionizing radiation. Due to this and the high soft-tissue contrast, MRI use has increased and has potential for use in longitudinal studies where changes in patients' anatomy or tumors at different time points are compared. Deformable image registration can be useful for these studies. Here, we describe two datasets that can be used to evaluate the registration accuracy of systems for MR images, as it cannot be assumed to be the same as that measured on CT images. Acquisition and validation methods: Two sets of images were created to test registration accuracy. (a) A porcine phantom was created by placing ten 0.35-mm gold markers into porcine meat. The porcine phantom was immobilized in a plastic container with movable dividers. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and CT images were acquired with the porcine phantom compressed in four different ways. The markers were not visible on the MR images, due to the selected voxel size, so they did not interfere with the measured registration accuracy, while the markers were visible on the CT images and were used to identify the known deformation between positions. (b) Synthetic images were created using 28 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who had MR scans pre-, mid-, and postradiotherapy treatment. An inter- and intrapatient variation model was created using these patient scans. Four synthetic pretreatment images were created using the interpatient model, and four synthetic post-treatment images were created for each of the pretreatment images using the intrapatient model. Data format and usage notes: The T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and CT scans of the porcine phantom in the four positions are provided. Four T1-weighted synthetic pretreatment images each with four synthetic post-treatment images, and four T2-weighted synthetic pretreatment images each with four synthetic post-treatment images are provided. Additionally, the applied deformation vector fields to generate the synthetic post-treatment images are provided. The data are available on TCIA under the collection MRI-DIR. Potential applications: The proposed database provides two sets of images (one acquired and one computer generated) for use in evaluating deformable image registration accuracy. T1- and T2-weighted images are available for each technique as the different image contrast in the two types of images may impact the registration accuracy.},

Radiotherapy is a standard treatment for this condition and the first step of the radiotherapy process is to identify the target volumes to be targeted and the healthy organs at risk (OAR) to be protected. Unlike previous methods for automatic segmentation of OAR that typically use local information and individually segment each OAR, in this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for the joint segmentation of OAR in CT images of the thorax, specifically the heart, esophagus, trachea and the aorta. Making use of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), we present several extensions that improve the performance, including a new architecture that allows to use low level features with high level information, effectively combining local and global information for improving the localization accuracy. Finally, by using Conditional Random Fields (specifically the CRF as Recurrent Neural Network model), we are able to account for relationships between the organs to further improve the segmentation results. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance on a dataset of 30 CT scans.},

We present SEGCloud, an end-To-end framework to obtain 3D point-level segmentation that combines the advantages of NNs, trilinear interpolation(TI) and fully connected Conditional Random Fields (FC-CRF). Coarse voxel predictions from a 3D Fully Convolutional NN are transferred back to the raw 3D points via trilinear interpolation. Then the FC-CRF enforces global consistency and provides fine-grained semantics on the points. We implement the latter as a differentiable Recurrent NN to allow joint optimization. We evaluate the framework on two indoor and two outdoor 3D datasets (NYU V2, S3DIS, KITTI, Semantic3D.net), and show performance comparable or superior to the state-of-The-Art on all datasets.},

abstract = {Techniques for automatically designing deep neural network architectures such as reinforcement learning based approaches have recently shown promising results. However, their success is based on vast computational resources (e.g. hundreds of GPUs), making them difficult to be widely used. A noticeable limitation is that they still design and train each network from scratch during the exploration of the architecture space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new framework toward efficient architecture search by exploring the architecture space based on the current network and reusing its weights. We employ a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller, whose action is to grow the network depth or layer width with function-preserving transformations. As such, the previously validated networks can be reused for further exploration, thus saves a large amount of computational cost. We apply our method to explore the architecture space of the plain convolutional neural networks (no skip-connections, branching etc.) on image benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, SVHN) with restricted computational resources (5 GPUs). Our method can design highly competitive networks that outperform existing networks using the same design scheme. On CIFAR-10, our model without skip-connections achieves 4.23{\%} test error rate, exceeding a vast majority of modern architectures and approaching DenseNet. Furthermore, by applying our method to explore the DenseNet architecture space, we are able to achieve more accurate networks with fewer parameters.},

abstract = {Automated whole breast ultrasound (ABUS) has been widely used as a screening modality for examination of breast abnormalities. Reviewing hundreds of slices produced by ABUS, however, is time consuming. Therefore, in this paper, a fast and effective computer-aided detection system based on 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and prioritized candidate aggregation is proposed to accelerate this reviewing. First, an efficient sliding window method is used to extract volumes of interest (VOIs). Then, each VOI is estimated the tumor probability with a 3-D CNN, and VOIs with higher estimated probability are selected as tumor candidates. Since the candidates may overlap each other, a novel scheme is designed to aggregate the overlapped candidates. During the aggregation, candidates are prioritized based on estimated tumor probability to alleviate over-aggregation issue. The relationship between the sizes of VOI and target tumor is optimally exploited to effectively perform each stage of our detection algorithm. On evaluation with a test set of 171 tumors, our method achieved sensitivities of 95{\%} (162/171), 90{\%} (154/171), 85{\%} (145/171), and 80{\%} (137/171) with 14.03, 6.92, 4.91, and 3.62 false positives per patient (with six passes), respectively. In summary, our method is more general and much faster than preliminary works and demonstrates promising results.},

We propose a frame-based convolutional neural network that correctly classifies COVID-19 US videos with a sensitivity of 0.98 ± 0.04 and a specificity of 0.91 ± 0.08 (frame-based sensitivity 0.93±0.05, specificity 0.87±0.07). We further employ class activation maps for the spatio-temporal localization of pulmonary biomarkers, which we subsequently validate for human-in-the-loop scenarios in a blindfolded study with medical experts. Aiming for scalability and robustness, we perform ablation studies comparing mobile-friendly, frame- and video-based architectures and show reliability of the best model by aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimates. We hope to pave the road for a community effort toward an accessible, efficient and interpretable screening method and we have started to work on a clinical validation of the proposed method. Data and code are publicly available.},

abstract = {Craniofacial landmark localization and anatomical structure tracing on cephalograms are two important ways to obtain the cephalometric analysis. In order to computerize them in parallel, a model-based approach is proposed to locate 262 craniofacial feature points, including 90 landmarks and 172 auxiliary points. In model training, 12 landmarks are selected as reference points and used to divide every training shape to 10 regions according to the anatomical knowledge; principle components analysis is employed to characterize the region shape variations and the statistical grey profile of every feature point. Locating feature points on an input image is a two-stage procedure. First, we identify the reference landmarks by image processing and pattern matching techniques, so that the shape partition is performed on the input image. Then, for each region, its feature points are located by a modified active shape model. All craniofacial anatomical structures can be traced out by connecting the located points with subdivision curves according to the prior knowledge. Users are permitted to modify the results interactively in many different ways. Experimental results show the advantage and reliability of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that curiosity is a mechanism found by evolution that encourages meaningful exploration early in an agent's life in order to expose it to experiences that enable it to obtain high rewards over the course of its lifetime. We formulate the problem of generating curious behavior as one of meta-learning: An outer loop will search over a space of curiosity mechanisms that dynamically adapt the agent's reward signal, and an inner loop will perform standard reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal. However, current meta-RL methods based on transferring neural network weights have only generalized between very similar tasks. To broaden the generalization, we instead propose to meta-learn algorithms: Pieces of code similar to those designed by humans in ML papers. Our rich language of programs combines neural networks with other building blocks such as buffers, nearest-neighbor modules and custom loss functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach empirically, finding two novel curiosity algorithms that perform on par or better than human-designed published curiosity algorithms in domains as disparate as grid navigation with image inputs, acrobot, lunar lander, ant and hopper.},

However, building a high-quality DL system for a specific task highly relies on human expertise, hindering its wide application. Meanwhile, automated machine learning (AutoML) is a promising solution for building a DL system without human assistance and is being extensively studied. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods – covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS) – with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms' performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research.},

abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extensively studied in the past few years. Arguably the revolutionary techniques are in the area of computer vision such as plausible image generation, image to image translation, facial attribute manipulation and similar domains. Despite the significant success achieved in the computer vision field, applying GANs to real-world problems still poses significant challenges, three of which we focus on here: (1) High quality image generation; (2) Diverse image generation; and (3) Stable training. Through an in-depth review of GAN-related research in the literature, we provide an account of the architecture-variants and loss-variants, which have been proposed to handle these three challenges from two perspectives. We propose loss-variants and architecture-variants for classifying the most popular GANs, and discuss the potential improvements with focusing on these two aspects. While several reviews for GANs have been presented to date, none have focused on the review of GAN-variants based on their handling the challenges mentioned above. In this paper, we review and critically discuss 7 architecture-variant GANs and 9 loss-variant GANs for remedying those three challenges. The objective of this review is to provide an insight on the footprint that current GANs research focuses on the performance improvement. Code related to GAN-variants studied in this work is summarized on https:// github.com/ sheqi/GAN Review.},

abstract = {Is it possible to develop an “AI Pathologist" to pass the board-certified examination of the American Board of Pathology? To achieve this goal, the first step is to create a visual question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent is presented with a pathology image together with a question and is asked to give the correct answer. Our work makes the first attempt to build such a dataset. Different from creating general-domain VQA datasets where the images are widely accessible and there are many crowdsourcing workers available and capable of generating question-answer pairs, developing a medical VQA dataset is much more challenging. First, due to privacy concerns, pathology images are usually not publicly available. Second, only well-trained pathologists can understand pathology images, but they barely have time to help create datasets for AI research. To address these challenges, we resort to pathology textbooks and online digital libraries. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract pathology images and captions from textbooks and generate question-answer pairs from captions using natural language processing. We collect 32,799 open-ended questions from 4,998 pathology images where each question is manually checked to ensure correctness. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset for pathology VQA. Our dataset will be released publicly to promote research in medical VQA.},

The results of the evaluation indicate that segmentation of the vessel lumen and media is possible with an accuracy that is comparable to manual annotation when semi-automatic methods are used, as well as encouraging results can be obtained also in case of fully-automatic segmentation.

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in image processing tasks. However, their high expression ability risks overfitting. Consequently, data augmentation techniques have been proposed to prevent overfitting while enriching datasets. Recent CNN architectures with more parameters are rendering traditional data augmentation techniques insufficient. In this study, we propose a new data augmentation technique called random image cropping and patching (RICAP) which randomly crops four images and patches them to create a new training image. Moreover, RICAP mixes the class labels of the four images, resulting in an advantage of the soft labels. We evaluated RICAP with current state-of-the-art CNNs (e.g., the shake-shake regularization model) by comparison with competitive data augmentation techniques such as cutout and mixup. RICAP achieves a new state-of-the-art test error of 2.19{\%} on CIFAR-10. We also confirmed that deep CNNs with RICAP achieve better results on classification tasks using CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, an image-caption retrieval task using Microsoft COCO, and other computer vision tasks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the segmentation of lung tumors that combines the powerful fully convolutional networks (FCN) based semantic segmentation framework (3D-UNet) and the graph cut based co-segmentation model. First, two separate deep UNets are trained on PET and CT, separately, to learn high level discriminative features to generate tumor/non-tumor masks and probability maps for PET and CT images. Then, the two probability maps on PET and CT are further simultaneously employed in a graph cut based co-segmentation model to produce the final tumor segmentation results. Comparative experiments on 32 PET-CT scans of lung cancer patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Semantic segmentation performs pixel-wise classification for given images, which can be widely used in autonomous driving, robotics, medical diagnostics and etc. The recent advanced approaches have witnessed rapid progress in semantic segmentation. However, these supervised learning based methods rely heavily on large-scale datasets to acquire strong generalizing ability, such that they are coupled with some constraints. Firstly, human annotation of pixel-level segmentation masks is laborious and time-consuming, which causes relatively expensive training data and make it hard to deal with urgent tasks in dynamic environment. Secondly, the outstanding performance of the above data-hungry methods will decrease with few available training examples. In order to overcome the limitations of the supervised learning semantic segmentation methods, this paper proposes a generalized meta-learning framework, named Meta-Seg. It consists of a meta-learner and a base-learner. Specifically, the meta-learner learns a good initialization and a parameter update strategy from a distribution of few-shot semantic segmentation tasks. The base-learner can be any semantic segmentation models theoretically and can implement fast adaptation (that is updating parameters with few iterations) under the guidance of the meta-learner. In this work, the successful semantic segmentation model FCN8s is integrated into Meta-Seg. Experiments on the famous few-shot semantic segmentation dataset PASCAL 5i prove Meta-Seg is a promising framework for few-shot semantic segmentation. Besides, this method can provide with reference for the relevant researches of meta-learning semantic segmentation.},

Second, using a multi-task objective to maximize the average reward across the training tasks is an effective method to meta-train RL policies. Third, past data from the meta-training replay buffer can be recycled to adapt the policy on a new task using off-policy updates. MQL draws upon ideas in propensity estimation to do so and thereby amplifies the amount of available data for adaptation. Experiments on standard continuous-control benchmarks suggest that MQL compares favorably with state of the art meta-RL algorithms.},

abstract = {A four-dimensional deformable image registration (4D DIR) algorithm, referred to as 4D local trajectory modeling (4DLTM), is presented and applied to thoracic 4D computed tomography (4DCT) image sets. The theoretical framework on which this algorithm is built exploits the incremental continuity present in 4DCT component images to calculate a dense set of parameterized voxel trajectories through space as functions of time. The spatial accuracy of the 4DLTM algorithm is compared with an alternative registration approach in which component phase to phase (CPP) DIR is utilized to determine the full displacement between maximum inhale and exhale images. A publically available DIR reference database (http://www.dir-lab.com) is utilized for the spatial accuracy assessment. The database consists of ten 4DCT image sets and corresponding manually identified landmark points between the maximum phases. A subset of points are propagated through the expiratory 4DCT component images. Cubic polynomials were found to provide sufficient flexibility and spatial accuracy for describing the point trajectories through the expiratory phases. The resulting average spatial error between the maximum phases was 1.25 mm for the 4DLTM and 1.44 mm for the CPP. The 4DLTM method captures the long-range motion between 4DCT extremes with high spatial accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

The proposed method explicitly takes into account the image features learned from a deep neural network. To this end, we estimate simultaneous probability maps over region and edge locations in CMR images using a fully convolutional network. Due to the distinct morphology of the heart in patients with PH, these probability maps can then be incorporated in a single nested level set optimisation framework to achieve multi-region segmentation with high efficiency. The proposed method uses an automatic way for level set initialisation and thus the whole optimisation is fully automated. We demonstrate that the proposed deep nested level set (DNLS) method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for CMR segmentation in PH patients.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},
