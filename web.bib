  abstract = {Over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the use of containers for deploying data center applications at scale. The reason for this is simple: containers encapsulate an application's dependencies to provide reproducible and reliable execution of applications and services without the overhead of a full virtual machine. If you have ever spent a day provisioning a server with a multitude of packages for a scientific or deep learning application, or have put in weeks of effort to ensure your application can be built and deployed in multiple linux environments.},
